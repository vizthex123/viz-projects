Divide mana cost by 10 to get EMC addition

Old idea:
100 Mana is +10 EMC

If ExtraE ever gets an add-on or unofficial release, change each tier as follows (transfer/gen | storage)

Mk 4 - 720 | 15,000,000
Mk 5 - 2,560 | 20,000,000
Mk 6 - 4,000 | 30,000,000

Collectors:

Mk 4 - 64 | 8,000
Mk 5 - 128 | 120,000
Mk 6 - 256 | 256,000

Gotta change the recipes too.
