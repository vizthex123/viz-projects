Big thanks to the GregTech New Horizons team for maintaining so many old mods.

I have no interest in the pack (and am a bit annoying the issue trackers are disabled for most of them, in addition to the majority not being on CurseForge) - but it's still great that a handful of people are still working on this ancient-ass version of Minecraft.
