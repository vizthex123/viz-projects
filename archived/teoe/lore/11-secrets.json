    If anyone finds this, the first thing you must know is that we weren't doing it for noble reasons. We were doing it because of the war. The Resource War, the greatest and mostly costly war history has ever seen.
	The tensions before the war was so palpable that you could cut it with your hands. It was terrible, everyone was anxious and paranoid that the next day would be there last.
	It started when the 3 main powers - Earth, the Mars Colony, and the Astroid Miners - became politically unstable, and went to war after awhile.
    I never participated in it; thankfully, but only because I was assignes to this project. As such, I do not know most of the details; so these logs will mostly be written by an old vetern of mine; SR-4863-0 - Codename: Goo. - Dr. Wynter, Log #10",
