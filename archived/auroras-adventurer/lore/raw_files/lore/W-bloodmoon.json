Some claim that even the dead rise up to enact revenge on those who slew them.\nIt's been known to drive people mad, especially since you aren't able to get a good night's sleep whilst one rages outside.\nThe only options for survival are to wait it out, or fight your way through.... if you can survive the hordes."
