Those who bear this title are known to be ruthless in battle, with skills almost surpassing those of the war god.\nThey are one of the oldest all-female warrior sects in existence, along with the Amazons and ancient guard order of the Aurorian Queen.\nNo one is quite sure why all Valkyries born are women, or if itâ€™s a knowledge so old it's been lost to time\nValkyries have guarded over the Aether Realm for millennia, and occasionally venture down to the mortal realm for reasons known only to them."
