    "body": "They constructed great temples to worship our Moon Goddess, with a ceremony where the princess was crowned as the queen in the goddessâ€™ name.\nBut as time passed, one princess became corrupted with power; and thought herself to be the real Goddess of the Moon. She became the first Moon Queen; and ruled the land with an iron fist, never seeking to return us to our great time of peace and prosperity."
