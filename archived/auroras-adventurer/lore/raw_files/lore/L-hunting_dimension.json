Some are said to have fought in the ancient war that led to the Abandonment of the Aurorian, long since faded into myth.\nThese legends also speak of a special realm, made for hunters by the great ones of old.\nHow to find it though, is a mystery. Not even the most ancient of scholars knows how to do that."
