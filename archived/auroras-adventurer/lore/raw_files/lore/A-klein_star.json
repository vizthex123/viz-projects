    "body": "The Klein Star is an ancient relic, as old as the art of alchemy itself. It harnesses the power of alchemical fuels to store EMC.\nSadly though, itâ€™s been fragmented due to the passage of time. But the art is not lost! \nTalented alchemists are able to re-forge this ancient relic, and use its power for themselves.\nAll we can do is hope that whoever crafts it is not bound to the forces of evil."
