    "body": "Long ago - when the realm of Twilight and Aurorian had just become one - a grand palace was constructed to commemorate the occasion.\nIt was called the Aurora Palace, and was visited by all the Aurorian Queens and Twilight Kings; both to conduct meetings, and as a place to relax and be free of the troubles of state.\nThis palace was always kept in top shape, and being located in the freezing cold tundra, had a natural barrier around it.\nBut all was lost when Queen Auroraâ€™s eldest sister commandeered the place. She ran it into the ground, and infected it with monsters.\nNow, we must hope it may one day be reclaimed; and restored to its former glory."
