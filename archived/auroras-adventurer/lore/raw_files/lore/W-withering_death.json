    "body": "Legends tell of an ancient curse, bound to the Nether Realm. It is said that this curse would corrupt the very bones of whoever caught it, rendering them a mere husk of what they once were.\nNow usually, a mixture of people is what one would expect to see. People from all walks of life, young and old, healthy and dying; succumbing to the curse and withering away.\nBut it seems this curse was more…. selective - It would only affect those of the elite guard in training. And these were no ordinary fighters, mind you; they were training to become part of the Moon Queen’s elite force.\nBut - as all things do - this too has fallen into obscurity. Now a mere myth; when it was once feared across the entire land."
