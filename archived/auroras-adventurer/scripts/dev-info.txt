CHARACTERS:

[M] Dr. Akashic - Main researcher, straight-forward but not rude. Creator of the Akashic Tome.
[F] Queen Aurora - Basically abducted you. Mysterious & unknown; but the loyalty of her subjects makes her seem trustworthy and noble.
[F] Dr. Haewyn Oseille (OH-si-ehl) - Half-Elf Botania researcher, always excited, upbeat, and talks way too much sometimes
[Male Demon] Oroxious the Bloody - Blood Magic wizard. Mysterious and reserved. Revealed as a demon later down the line (spoilers!)

[M] Archmage Interdem - ElectroBlob's Wizardry researcher. Also an alchemist.
[Unknown] Azoless, Twilight Guide - Resident of the Twilight Forest. No one has seen them before, and doesn't know if they're male or female. Many speculate they're some type of magical creature though. (True identity revealed at the end of the Twilight Forest quests)
- Talks about itself in third person
-- Highly trusted by the Queen
--- Former King of Twilight

[M] {Dr.} Forgebrow - Dwarf in charge of all technology-related research. Hates being called Doctor. Generally cheerful. Loves to tell people about gemstones and Dwarven engineering.
[F] Artemis - Manages the shops. She'll inform you of "good deals" that may arise. Sometimes tries to annoy people, especially Forgebrow. Totally not a reference.
[F] Aryana - Drya in charge of Elementaristics
[F] Eir - Falen Valkyrie who helps you overthrow the Valkryie Queen. She wants to be accepted by them again.


[M] The Archivist - Meticulously cataloges every scrap of information about the kingdom and its inhabitants. Very reclusive.


Character Relationships:

Forgebrow and Oseille don't get along well, since Dwarves and Elves hate each other
Akashic works well with everyone, but can have difficuly with Azoless (since they only communicate over interdimensional mail, which is inefficient)
(Archmage) Interdem works fine with everyone, even bettter with Oseille {since they both cover magic}

Azoless doesn't really care as much about interpersonal relationships, but does work fine enough with everyone (especially Oseille, (Archmage) Interdem, and Oroxius, since they're in charge of the magical things)

The Librarian is known, yet nothing is known about them

Atremis loves teasing Forgebrow by calling him "Doctor" (which he hates)
Forgebrow doesn't actually mind, but he pretends to be annoyed
