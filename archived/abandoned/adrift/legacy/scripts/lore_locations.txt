Abandoned Nook:

It's been....oh, months I guess, since I broke my leg and fell into this forsaken cranny.
There's too many monsters outside to attempt a safe escape, especially in my condition.

At least the ceiling is rather open. Hopefully some fish get sucked into the current.
I've plugged them up every night with some of the sponges in here, just in case something nasty gets in.

I think that's how I'm gonna get buried down here - dead as fertilizer for my meager farm, with a bunch of sponges between me and the short swim upwards.

I locked up my valuables when I first got here, and stupidly dropped the key down below.
The rest of my supplies are in the chest, and whatever's left of me will probably be laying around somewhere.

I bid farewell to this godforsaken ocean.
