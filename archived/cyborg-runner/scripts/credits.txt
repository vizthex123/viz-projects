Thanks to @FCP211#6685 on Discord for suggesting the satchel at the start be named 'Evidence Bag' (in a very old build)
Thanks to @Phillap#6464 on Discord for telling me what Targeted Immunosuppressant does (+max tolerance but some negative potion effects are worse)
Thanks to Alivda on the Discord for testing the modpack in its early stages
Thanks to truepuregold on the Discord for suggesting I make research hints & add scannable (and testing the pack a few times)
Thanks to masterfulpotato on Discord for making half the sprites (the bottled items, coin mold, damage solarskin, melon circuit, ring, and anything with "xorger" in the filename)
- XDFlame made the other half



And finally, thanks to everyone for playing. Not much of a modpack if nobody plays it, right?
