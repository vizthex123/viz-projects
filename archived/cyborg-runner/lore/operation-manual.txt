Operation Instructions:

1) Package all necessary supplies, and place them into the storage modules.

Board any passengers alongside any extra cargo they bring on-board.



2) Assume position in the pilot's seat and enter your credentials.

Note: All passengers will be scanned.

Any passengers posessing criminal records will be ejected to the nearest planet deemed "survivable".



3) Secure all passengers and cargo, then begin the launch sequence.

After the ship finishes scanning everyone on-board, the launch sequence will begin.

If the pilot fails the scan, the autopilot AI will take over.
