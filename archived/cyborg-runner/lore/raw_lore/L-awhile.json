I haven’t bothered making more logs for a while now, but I figured I could archive at least a bit - just in case, you know?\nIn the past few months, I’ve noticed that the replacement leg has been failing. I’ve run some diagnostics, seems the issue is just dirt & dust building up, rather than some deep-seated structural failure.\nIt will still require some work (and materials) to repair, but at least I’ll still have a leg up on this place, haha…\nI hope someone groaned in pain at that. It would almost make all of this worth it."
