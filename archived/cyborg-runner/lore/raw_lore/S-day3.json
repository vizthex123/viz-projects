I feel like I'm next...\nI've been gathering supplies from everyone's house, but some still remain. I can't carry everything, but I plan to go back soon.\nHere's hoping someone else survived.\nI'll need help to construct a proper quaratine dome, and although I could do it alone it'd go much faster if I had help."
