I did manage to cobble together a barely-functional ship AI, but it’s not very efficient. Keeps using all the power I can generate.\nMost of the internals are done, but all the circuitry is going to be a pain to get. It seems there’s almost nothing here that I could use (other than those melons - but there’s no way they’ll be powerful enough to fly a ship).\nI’ve been trying to find alternatives, but the ship’s AI hasn’t been much help, and I don’t know the first thing about how to design my own circuits.\nI’m hoping to find some usable spares in a few of these wrecks, but my hopes aren’t set very high."
