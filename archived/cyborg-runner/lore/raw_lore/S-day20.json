    "body": "Almost a month since the outbreak. Supplies are running low, and we've barely been able to scavenge a day's worth of food each time we venture outside.\nThe areas beyond the village have been barely accessible, and only have a handful of useful materials. We keep finding spare armour, weapons, and even tools. Useful for gathering supplies, but they're not edible...\nI did find a basic communications beacon though. Seems like it only connects to a single market world, but they've been able to sell us a few supplies with what little money we had left.\nHoping we can find a way out soon."
