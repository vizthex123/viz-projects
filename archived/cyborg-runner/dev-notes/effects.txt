All nutrients now give various potion effects at different levels: (X = positive effect, based on the nutrient level. Y is a negative effect)

<=25 - Y3
26 - 40 - Y2
41 - 49 - Y1

50 - 60 = No effect(s)

60 - 75 - X1
76 - 90 - X2
91 - 100 - X3

This encourages you to keep your nutrients up, while also not being too over/underpowered
