p is the standard point output (1)

Rocks recipe: Makes 1p (50 ticks slower than the standard recipe)
Standard recipe: Makes 1.5p
- Advanced: Condenses the rocks and standard recipes into a single recipe that makes 1.25p, but requires twice as many itemss
Organic recipe: Makes 2p (50 ticks faster than the standard recipe and requires 2 Carbon. 1 Carbon for the Advanced version)
- Advanced: Makes 4p (uses half as much Carbon, but needs 8k RF)

The Advanced Lab halves the required time to make points, and sometimes reduces the resource requirements.
