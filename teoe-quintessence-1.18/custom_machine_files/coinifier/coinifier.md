# Guidelines for Coinification recipes

RF cost & duration is per coin type (amount given is irrelevant).
- Cost is determined by the highest value coin the item gives.

Copper: 500 (3 seconds)<br />
Iron: 1,000 (5 seconds)<br />
Gold: 2,500 (7 seconds)<br />
Emerald: 5,000 (10 seconds)<br />
Diamond: 15,000 (15 seconds)<br />
Netherite: 30,000 (30 seconds)

If there's only one coin output, it goes in the middle slot.
