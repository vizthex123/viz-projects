RF cost & duration is per coin type (amount given is irrelevant).

Determined by the highest value coin the item gives.

Copper: 500 (3 seconds)
Iron: 1,000 (5 seconds)
Gold: 2,500 (7 seconds)
Emerald: 5,000 (10 seconds)
Diamond: 15,000 (15 seconds)
Netherite: 30,000 (30 seconds)

if there's only one coin output, it goes in the middle slot.
