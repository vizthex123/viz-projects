# Guidelines for Arc Furnace recipes

# Standards

Just like the Shredder, this also has recursive item gains (so components are also accounted in the recipe outputs)

## Scrap

Uses 50% more rf than the smelting recipe (3,000), but takes the same amount of time (10 seconds)
- Tiny items take 1,000 and 5 seconds
- Big items take 6,000 and 15 seconds
<br />
- Tiny items give 2 nuggets
- Big items give 18 nuggets
- Gives double the items in nuggets (e.g. 1 small scrap becomes 6 nuggets)
- Exceptions for hybrid items (like Rose Gold)
<br />
- Gives double the XP of smelting the scrap
-- liquid amount is doubled for big items and halved for tiny items

<br />

## Non-scrap

Uses 50% more rf than the shredder recipe, and takes less time (7.5 seconds for blocks {5 for partial blocks, 10 for double blocks, 15 for bigger ones}, 3 for items)
- Everything not listed below is lost
- Gives double the items in nuggets (e.g. 1 small scrap becomes 6 nuggets)
-- If the recipe uses a Trading Core with no other metals, it gives 10 mB of XP
<br />
- Ender Pearls become Resonant Ender (125 mB per)
- Redstone becomes Destabilized Redstone (50 mB per)
- Glass Shards becomes Molten Glass (125 mB per)
- Ink Sacs become Ink (125 mB per)
<br />
- Blaze Powder has a 25% recovery chance
- Trading Cores are smelted into 2 Nugget Melds and 4 Gold Nugget
<br />
- Stone becomes Lava (500 mB per block)
- Glass becomes Molten Glass (500 mB per block - 125 for panes)
- Concrete becomes Liquid White Concrete (500 mB per block)
- If there's no fluid outputs left, convert XP into Create's nuggets (worth 3 points each)
<br />
- Nugget outputs give Melds instead if the outputs match (cuz it all melts together, ya know?)
-- Each meld is worth 1 of each nugget (Iron + Gold and Emerald + Diamond), and can be Arc Smelted into the proper Nuggets (also works in an Induction Smelter)
