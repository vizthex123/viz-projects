# vizthex's Projects Repository

*Welcome to the GitHub repository for all of my Minecraft modpacks! (and published scripts)*

Mods and datapacks will have their own repositories. You can find a full list of my projects on my [CurseForge profile](https://www.curseforge.com/members/vizthex/projects), and refer to the [wiki](https://radiancemodding.wiki.gg/wiki/Radiance_Modding_Wiki) for extra information about them.
 
This is where you'll report issues, make suggestions, etc. outside of the CurseForge comments section (or issue tracker if it's a [legacy pack](https://radiancemodding.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Legacy_Modpacks)) and [discord server](https://discord.gg/NtwzA6X).

The files in here will be the configs, default configs (if the pack is for 1.16 or higher), lore, scripts, custom item textures, changelogs, and a few development notes I've made while making each pack.

*If you would like to provide translations or textures for any of my custom items, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/vizthex123/viz-projects/pulls) or tell me in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/NtwzA6X)*

*If you would like to translate one of my mods, make a pull request on that mod's GitHub page, leave a comment, DM me, or tell me in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/NtwzA6X)*
