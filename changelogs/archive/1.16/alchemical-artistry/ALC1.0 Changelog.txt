v1.0 Changelog:


Now marked as a full release
- Should've done this at the start, but oh well
The modpack now has an end goal: Make an Alchemical Sampling to impress the Alchemical Bureau
- It costs a bit of everything, but shouldn't be too hard
Everything* now has an AMC value and recipes to go with it
- *Other than any items I might have missed, demon will & items related to it, and unobtainable stuff


Changed the texture of the Sub & Microscopic Matter Crystals
Added a new "Crystalpression" catalyst
- Made with 1 Crystallization and 1 Compression. Used in special "crystalpress" recipes that give both bags and crystals.
- Might change them back to just one of each Catalyst since this extra step is really only used to distinguish the recipes at a glance
Improved all Ender Crafting recipes
- Now you use stacked catalysts for them if more than 1 is needed
- Made the recipe times way less grindy too. New values are (AMC | Time in seconds):
<500 | 5 or AMC value
500 - 1,000 | 10
1k+ | 15
2.5k+ | 30
5k+ | 45
10k+ | 60
15k+ | 75
25k+ | 90


Crates now say "Storing X AMC" instead of "Holding"
- This makes it easier to distinguish the 2 types of items without having to look at the textures. Plus I think it sounds better.
Removed some useless recipes for the 1k crate
- Migrated the 6k recipe to the 10k crate
Hid several unused/creative items from JEI
Removed a bunch of useless items/recipes
HWYLA should now be hidden when gaining an advancement
- Stupid thing didn't save last time >:{
- Have I mentioned how I hate this new config system since it never saves anything?
Advancement Plaques now last for their intended amounts of time
- Tasks stay for 5 seconds
- Goals stay for 7
- Challenges stay for 10
- Also reduced the spacing to 12 pixels so it doesn't feel like it's in the middle of the screen, and tweaked the fade in/out effects a tad
Fixed some improperly coloured tooltips


Nerfed axe damage (as it should be)
- All of them have been reduced by half, like it was before Mojang broke the game.
Netherite Swords now do 10 damage (which should be in Beta v1.0, but I think I forgot to add it to the changelog)
DefaultOptions should now properly load into new installs
Fixed my custom glass and leather recipes not working (oops)
Mineshafts are now rarer
Added a few quality-of-life recipes
Added the "Music Discs" tag to the discs from Odd Water Mobs
Reduced the burn times of Banner Patterns to 200
Added a burn time to sugar cane and paper (50)
Increased the burn time of paper walls to 400 (was 300)
Items worth 0.5 AMC can now be crafted into 1 AMC bags
Items worth 3 or 4 AMC can now be crafted into 5 AMC bags
Items worth 6, 7, 8, or 9 AMC can now be crafted into 10 AMC bags
Adjusted the amount of Catalysts needed for some recipes



Replaced Simple Discord Rich Presence with DiscordRichPresence


Added Portable Crafting Table


Deleted Vault Research
Removed Thermal Cultivation
- It adds almost nothing useful (not even machines to automate farming with!) so there's no reason for me to waste time adding AMCs to everything from it
