Dev Build 2 Changelog:


Overhauled the entire ticket/token system
Added *a lot* of AMC values (seriously it took like 2 days)
Changed a few AMC values (I think?)
Greatly expanded upon the quest system, added a few shops and uses for tickets & tokens
- Tokens can be used to purchase various materials of the AMC tier they're a part of (AMC tooltips are coloured based on said tiers)
- Tickets can be used to purchase rare materials/collectibles
- You can gain tokens/tickets by crafting them or selling rare items


Changed the texture for both Token Catalysts
Added 3 new tokens: Azure, Minium, and Alchemist's
- If you can figure out where I got the names for the ashen, verdant, azure, and minium ones from, let me know to win 10,000 internet points. And maybe a special role or something.
Added 3 new token catalysts: Very Advanced Token Catalyst, Highly Advanced Token Catalyst, and Alchemist's Advanced Token Catalyst
- Each tier is used to be the corrosponding token, because a few of them have overlapping recipes. I may change this later.
Added a few new recipes for Alchemical Bags/Crates
Should've fixed some items missing tooltips (may have missed a few though)
Gave Deep Sand items an AMC
