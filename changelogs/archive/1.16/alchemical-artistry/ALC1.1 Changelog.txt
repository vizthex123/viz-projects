v1.1 Changelog


Buffed the Black Dye recipes made in the Induction Smelter
Added a recipe to make Black Iron out of Iron Ore
Removed my Rotten Flesh > Leather recipes
- Both Thermal Expansion and Blood Magic add their own, so mine are kind of redundant (and breaks the Redstone Furnace recipe)
Disabled singularity recipes (because for some reason they just wanted to be re-enabled I guess?)
- Advanced Energy Pipes now transfer 250 RF/t
- You may have to manually copy the config over (because for some reason it's not universal, stupid modern MC versions). Find it in the defaultconfigs folder, and copy it to the serverconfig folder of your world(s)


Nether Quartz now makes 75,000 RF in a Lapidary Dynamo
Added a recipe to make Torches out of Dwarf Torches (4 dwarf to 1 torch)
Added a recipe to convert 125 AMC items to a 250 AMC crate
Added a recipe to combine 35 and 15 AMC items to make a 50 AMC bag
Changed the AMC of Stone Swords (should be 5.25, was 2.75)
Added AMC to items from Mowzie's Mobs
Added a Keep Inventory quest
