- Pink Slime Crystal (50) {custom item}


Added recipes to crush Electrodynamic's useless ores
- Also added one to crush Vanadite into its impure dust and (rarely) crushed lead
Reduced the amount of time the wraps + water > porkchops recipe takes
Added a recipe to convert TConstruct ladders to vanilla ones (since they're non-functional for some reason?)



Added Storage Racks

- Added 3 custom items, though the textures are currently broken and I have no idea why. They're fully functional though, so I went ahead and kept them in.
