v3.2.2 Changelog


Fixed the food pouch recipes not accepting any damage value (oops)
- Note that anything inside the pouches will be lost when upgraded
Removed the recipes for the automatic pouches (since they've been disabled, though the mod should've done this on its own...)
- They should also be hidden in JEI
Added a tooltip to Slimesteel Reinforcements listing the capacity increase
Massively reduced the size of clay veins (from 33 to 8)
- Reduced the spawnrate to 7 (redstone is 8)


Added a recipe to convert Pink Slimeballs into their fluid at a MixerÂ 
Changed the recipe for every Repair Chest. Due to them not using resources of any kind after crafting, I find the recipes bit hard to balance.
- I think this has a good balance to it, but they may change (again) in the future
Added a quest to make some Storage Racks
Changed the rewards for a few quests
Renamed the "Gift" tier of the Engineering Guild to "Gifted"


Added Storage Racks


Disabled The Outer End since at least 3 people are having the same crash (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/netherium/issues/1 and https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/netherium/issues/2, also in the comments)
- Disabled the crystal recipes for now until the mod gets fixed
