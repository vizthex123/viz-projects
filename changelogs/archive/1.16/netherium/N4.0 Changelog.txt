v4.0 Changelog

All the gift quests should now register properly (Issue #6)
Fixed the Warped Wood recipe using an Oak Wood Plank (Issue #4)

If the game decides to load them in, there should be extra bounties for nether items, the Anointing Table should drop itself, and the Nether Furnaces should accept more items as fuel (Nether Bricks, Netherite Scrap, and Netherite Ingots)
- All of these (very annoyingly) use datapacks, which is a system I barely know exists.


Added my own Lapis Sheet (but I copied the texture from Create since I can't do art) since the Create devs removed it.
- Recipe is pressing 1 Lapis Block, makes 2 Sheets
Adjusted the config for Powah
- Solid fuels generate less power (Coal makes 16,000), Magma and Blazing Blood can be used for Thermo Generators, and Essence can be used as Thermo Coolant. Reduced Blazing Crystal Blocks to 2,500 °C (from 2,800 °C)
- Reduced the capacity of all Batteries
- Transfer rates are now 1/100 of their capacity
- *Heavily* nerfed the generator rate of Magmators. Magma can now be used in them.


Reduced the fuel usage of all jetpacks (amount in parenthesis is the usage per second), also slightly re-balanced a few:
- Copper: 75 > 10 (200)
- Bronze: 150 > 18 (360)
- Iron: 150 > 20 (400) {Now has +1 Armour Toughness}
- Silver: 150 > 21 (420) {Now gives +2 Armour and Armour Toughness}
- Gold: 400 > 23 (460) {Now gives 3 Armour instead of 4}
- Steel: 400 > 25 (500) {Now has +1 Armour Toughness}
- Diamond: 500 > 30 (600)
- Emerald: 500 > 45 (900) {Now has +2 Armour Toughness}

They should now seem more like "alternative upgrades" rather than a direct progression (For example: Gold is more enchantable than Steel, but gives less defense). You can read the tooltips for their full info.


Fixed the Wrapped Fuel Core not being named properly
Fixed the second Wrapped Fuel Core recipes not being loaded into the game correctly
- Increased the crafting time of the string recipe by 50 ticks (now takes 20 seconds)

Added Compacting versions of all Uranium Fuel Item recipes
- All of them take 200 ticks (10 seconds) unless stated otherwise
Changed the stacksize of each Uranium Fuel item
- Halved them all, but the Fuel Core is now unstackable.
Increased the amount of XP the Pink Slime and Blood Crystals give when smelted
Changed Blood Crystals to give 20 Overslime instead of 15
Added recipes to convert the Pink Slime and Blood Crystals to usable Slime Crystals from TiC
- Updated tooltips of them both 


Reduced the time it takes for Vanadium, Thoranite, and Uraninite to be crushed
Change the Vanadium Ore crushing wheel recipe
- Now gives 2 Impure Dust, a 5% chance for 1 Pure Dust, a 15% chance to get 3 Crushed Lead Ore, and a 15% chance to get 1 Cobblestone
