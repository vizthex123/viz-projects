v5.3 Changelog


Buffed the Crying Obsidian & Glowstone gained from recycling a Respawn Anchor
Slightly buffed the amount of Uraninite gained from processing its ore
- The Uraninite ores from Powah can now be processed into Uraninite in a Create Crusher (if you want to silk touch them)
Fixed the duplicate recipes for Fire Charges
Disabled the conversion recipes for my custom slime crystals since they seem to be working now (at least in my dev world)
- Updated their textures to try and match the Tinker's ones better
- Pink Slime Crystals now take 15 seconds to blast (was 20)


Fyrite and Superconductive Dusts now have the fuel_dust tag
Changed the rewards of the "Metallic Flight" quest
Fixed a couple quests not working correctly
The death quest now makes you lose 15 reputation instead of 5
Added a new quest to activate Keep Inventory
- Gives 5 Hellraisers reputation and costs a few materials. Can be unlocked after dying 3 times.
The flower quests now give more Hellraiser reputation (now 15/10, was 5)
The sand quest now gives 5 Hellraiser reputation (was 10)
- Note that you won't get the new reputation rewards if you finished the quests before the update.
Fixed a few known issues


Added Refined Pipes
- Overhauled the config file and recipes to match the modpack's progression
- This is mainly meant to be used for fluids and energy, as those 2 forms of transport are somewhat lacking in the pack
- (I may disable the item and energy pipes later on since those 2 do exist already)
