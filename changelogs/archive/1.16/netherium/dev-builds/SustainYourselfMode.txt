Added an optional gamemode: Sustain Yourself. (probably gonna renaim it later)
You can enable this by enabling the Diet and Water Source mods, and disabling Classic Bars (as it breaks the UI - reported to the authors).
Be sure to rename the general_common.sustain file in the powah config (config/powah) to general_common.toml! (be sure to delete the existing .tmol config first)
- The player now starts with a book stating these same instructions

To enable it on an existing world, enable the mods (listed above), then copy the diet-groups.toml and diet-effects.toml files from the defaultconfig folder into your world's serverconfig folder, and rename the general_common.sustain file in the powah config (config/powah) to general_common.toml (be sure to delete the existing .tmol config first).

Currently, water can only be gained from vanilla items, but I'll expand the list if I can find out how to do so.
You can do @watersource in JEI to find most of the supported items though. (item tooltips will also say so)


There are 6 different nutrients to manage:
- Grains [starts at 50%]
- Fruits [starts at 45%]
- Vegetables [starts at 40%]
- Proteins (drains are 85% the rate of the others) [starts at 35%]
- Vitamins (drains at 50% the rate of the others) [starts at 60%]
- Sugars (drains 25% faster than the others) [starts at 75%]

Different nutrient levels will apply different effects to the player:
- If Fruits are below 20%, you'll gain Weakness I
- If Vegetables are below 30%, you'll gain Posion II
- If Proteins are below 25%, you'll gain Hunger I and Slowness II
- If Vitamins are below 35%, you'll gain Blindness I and Slowness I
- If Sugars are below 15%, you'll gain Slowness I

- If everything (excluding sugars) is above 85%, you'll gain 2 extra Max Health and 0.5 extra attack damage for each nutrient above the threshold.
- If Sugars and Vitamins are above 85%, your movement speed will increase by 5% for each one above the threshold
- If Proteins and Vitamins are above 90%, you'll gain 2 Armour Toughness
- If Vitamins are above 80%, you'll gain 1 Luck
- If everything averages out to 60% or higher, you'll gain 1 Knockback Resistance



Added & disabled Diet (Forge)
Added & disabled Water Source
- If both are enabled (and Classic Bars is disabled), you'll be playing in the new "Sustain Yourself" mode. I'm looking into ways to make this a command or something, but for now this is the best I can do. More info at the top of the changelog (you should've seen it first lol) and in the Discord.
