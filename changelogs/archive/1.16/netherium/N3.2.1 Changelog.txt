v3.2.1 Changelog


Now marked as a full release since things seem fairly stable!
Should've fixed the crash with Create multiple people seem to have.
- I can't replicate it though, so perhaps updating Java will fix it?

Magma Cream can no longer be put in a Fuel Canister
Mini Coal & Charcoal can now be put in a Fuel Canister
Added tooltips to items that increase Overslime
Fixed the Blood & Pink Slime crystals having the wrong smelting times
Fixed the Ultimate Repair Chest using a Copper Sheet
Changed the recipe for the Advanced Repair Chest
- Now uses Rose Gold and Brass Sheets


Added a quest to make a Fuel Canister
- Added tooltips to it with a list of accepted fuels, like in my other modpacks
Added a quest to make a Waystone
- Also added the mod back, since it got removed for some reason?
Renamed the Engineer's Guld to the Engineering Guild


Updated Large Ore Deposits
Updated Enchantment Descriptions


Deleted Jet Boots
Removed Armor Slots in other Inventories
- It has issues with several UIs, which I did report to the mod dev; but they don't seem super active so it may not get fixed.
