v5.0 Changelog

 

Hopefully made the datapack configs actually load into the game

Re-balanced Powah
- Re-did my changes from v4.0 since the stupid game didn't save them:
- Solid fuels generate less power (Coal makes 16,000), Magma and Blazing Blood can be used for Thermo Generators. Reduced Blazing Crystal Blocks to 2,500°C (from 2,800°C)"

- Reduced the capacity of all Batteries (Transfer rates are now 1/100 of their capacity)
- Magmators now generate far less, but accept liquid magma and blazing blood
- Furnators now generate a bit less
- Solar Panels now generate a bit more
- Thermo Generators now generate a bit more, and you can use Purified Water (-5°C) and Soul Water (5°C) as a coolant
- Reactors generate an transfer a tad more, but store less

 

Reduced the burn time of Dried Kelp to 400
Copied the Advancement Plaque settings from my Alchemical Artistry pack
Both kinds of flesh wrap now have a 30% chance to drop from milled wallcreep
Changed the polished basalt/blackstone recipes for the millstone to use 4 instead of 3
- Now uses 2 Cogwheels

You can now get an extra Powdered Obsidian when crushing Crying Obsidian
Removed the water_provider tag from Abscess Danishes
Added a recipe to mix Burning Blossoms into Lava (makes 50 mB per flower)
Added recipes to convert new items from Comfortable Nether into Lava:
- Liquid Grimdrop + 2 Grimdrop Stem: Makes 250 mB, requires heating. Not sure how to get it yet, so this is subject to change. I did add a recipe for Liquid Grimdrop though, just in case it's not currently obtainable and/or is rare.
- Flaming Abscess: 125 mB

 

Added a recipe to mill Shroomlight into Glowstone and Brown/Red Mushrooms
- You won't get fungi this way (and the chances for mushrooms and glowstone are reduced), but it lets you process them earlier - if you want to.
