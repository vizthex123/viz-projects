v5.2 Changelog


Gutted the "Sustain Yourself" mode
- It doesn't fit with this pack and is honestly painful to deal with. If you liked it though, feel free to just copy the files over from an old version.
Overhauled the fuel values for all uranium fuel items
- Changed their recipes, everything is now compacting-only and crafts much faster (cores still use mechanical crafting though)
- Pellets no longer use Coal
- Drops can now use anything with the forge:fuel_dust tag
Changed the default InvTweaks behaviour
- Now keeps food in your first slot, and the first slot is also locked
- Auto-restocking is disabled by default (which has been a thing for all updates)
- To change these, edit or delete the config


Added a new tier to the Engineering Guild: Ultimate Engineer (325 rep)
- You can only gain this after maxing out the reputation, and it'll give you something nice.
Increased the rep reward (for the collector) from "An Eggscellent Offering" to 15
Added a few new quests
(hopefully) fixed some broken quests


Vanadium ore tweaks:
- Removed JAOPCA's recipe, so now my custom one should be the only one
- Now gives some Crushed Vanadium (2), increased dust outputs
Tweaked the droprates of Uraninite's crushing recipes
Thoranite ore now rarely gives some Vandium Dust (both kinds)
Monazite ore now always gives 1 Raw Uraninite, and gives Cobblestone more often
Added recipes to smelt fish into fish


Tweaked Nether Portal Spread's settings since it seemed to be causing lag when you go to the overworld
- If you still have problems, just disable or remove Nether Portal Spread
Tweaked the clay worldgen rates
- It should appear a bit less often now
Added a recipe to make Glass in a Blast Furnace
Added a recipe to make Stone in a Blast Furnace
- I have no idea why these aren't in vanilla yet
Fixed the recipe conflict between the flesh > crimson stem and flesh > bramble recipes

Reduced the amount of time Andesite Alloy takes to craft in a Mixer
Fixed torch recipes not being mirrable
