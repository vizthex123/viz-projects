v3.3 Changelog


The default JourneyMap theme should now be the nether fortress one
Tinker's Construct should now turn items into their Create and Electrodynamics variants before using its own
Removed the water_provider tag from Phantom Membranes
- The recipes shouldn't have conflicted, but just in case.
Added a new recipe to use 4 items with the water_provider tag to make 750 mB of water
The pummeler remants recipe for Blaze Cake Base no longer requires heating
Added recipes to process anything with the forge:stone tag into Cobblestone, Gravel (25%), and Sand (15%) in Crushing Wheels
- Any existing recipes should override it
Reduced the burn time of the Uranium Canister to 2,560 (128 items smelted)
- Added multiple new tiers of uranium fuel cell-type items, from pellet (16 smelted items) to a dense core (8,192 smelted items). Might remove the super high-tier ones later on, but for now I think they're fine.
All of Electrodymanics' advanced ores (uraninite, monazite, etc.) now sometimes give cobblestone when crushed (like other ores do)
Fixed my custom crushed ore smelting recipes swapping the times for blasting & smelting
Baleen Filters now turn into water instead of lava


Changed the fluid Magma Cream to Magma Cream recipes to use a Spout
Removed my custom tooltip from Slimesteel Reinforcements
Changed the final stage of Obsidian crafting to use Compacting instead of Mixing
The Coin Press now uses Lava instead of Magma Cream (fluid), and requires no heating
Fixed the first quest not registering due to asking for the wrong quest book (sorry about breaking that, lol)
Fixed the command reward on Metallic Fight being broken
Doused Torches (both kinds) can now be milled (or crushed) back into some resources


Carrot on a Stick and Fishing Rods can now be recycled in a Mill
Added a recipe to craft torches using mini (char)coal
- I was originally going to fix all the duplicate recipes, but the game won't make them work in the 2x2 grid and I don't know why
Disabled overworld recipe for Agility Oil
- I might re-add it (alongside other overworld recipes for things), but I'm still not quite sure
