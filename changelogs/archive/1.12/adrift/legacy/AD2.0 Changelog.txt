v2.0 Changelog:


BE SURE TO MAKE A NEW WORLD AFTER YOU UPDATE!


Replaced Better Questing with FTB Quests
- I wanted to make a cool custom theme for the book, but nothing is working out; and the mod itself is *incredibly* annoying to use. I've used FTB Quests extensively due to how flexible and easy it is. Wanted to change things around a bit for this pack, but it's more trouble than it's worth.


Added more lore pages
- Due to the mod constantly killing itself though, I've gone ahead and disabled it.
Added the Overgrown Stone Brick texture pack
- This makes the UIs more closely themed to what I'm going for, and is (should be) enabled by default.


Changed the structure of the Iron Centrifuge
Changed the structure of the Lava Fractioner


Added research for the Alloy Smelter and SAG Mill
Expanded the list of items accepted by the "Cooking" and "Better Cooking" research
Changed the recipes for the Alloy Smelter and SAG Mill
- They now use parts from their original multiblock machine (Alloy Furnace and Pulverizer) to craft
- Costs less than the original machine (since they're more efficient and require research)


Re-balanced (almost) all the armour sets in the game
- Gave every set a skill requirement
- Leather is unchanged, and is intended to be the first set you get.
- Bone Armour now gives 9 defense total (was 12). Requires Defense 2.
- Hardened Leather Armour now gives 10 Defense and 2 Toughness (was 13/0). Requires Defense 3.
- Chainmail Armour is unchanged other than now requiring Defense 4
- Golden Armour is intended to be an alternative to Chainmail, and requires Defense 3 and Magic 2. Unchanged otherwise.
Horse Armour (called Pet Armor in-game) now gives a Saddle (25% chance) when recycled
Diamond Armour (full set) now gives 6 toughness instead of 8


Added recycler recipes for Stone Tools
Added recycler recipes for Iron Tools
Added recycler recipes for Golden Tools
Added recycler recipes for Neptunium Armour & Tools
Re-balanced a few recycling recipes


Added names and requirements to all Artisan's Worktables recipes
- This is almost entirely a technical change though, so you can pretty much ignore it

Simplified & standardized Modular Machine's input/output block recipes
- Added recipes for the last few missing ones, and disabled everything higher than Reinforced
Configured Modular Machines' Fluid & Energy In/outputs
- Fluid is now 250/500/1000/4000
- Energy is now 512/1024/2048/8192
- Energy RF/t rate is now 64/128/256/1024



The combination recipes for Studded Armour now accept any damage value
Added recipes to recycle Power Cells & Batteries
Reduced the amount of time it takes to recycled both damaged anvils
Reduced the amount of Iron you get from recycling a Damaged Anvil by 1
Removed the furnace adapter from the Alloy Smelter
- This should prevent it from having that empty recipe (idk what's even causing that)
Changed the recipes for Grains of Infinity in the Iron Centrifuge
- One now uses 1,000 mB of Fire Water + Obsidian to make 5 (50% chance to get 5 extra) {Uses 12,000 RF}
- The other is now 1,000 mB of Lava to make 2 (with a 50% chance to get 1 extra) {Uses 24,000 RF}


Renamed the "Energy Extractor" to the "Caloric Ignitor"
- Ink Sacs now take twice as long to process (but make the same amount of RF)
- Raw Fish now makes 1,200 RF at 6/tick (was 1,000 at 5/tick)
- Should've fixed the upgrade not working properly
Added Caloric Ignitor recipes for Cooked (2,000 RF per) & Cured Fish (1,600 RF per)
Removed Fish Fillet combo recipes from the Caloric Ignitor
- They kept being ignored by the game, not sure why.
Fixed my speed upgrades for a few Modular Machines not actually making them faster (oops)


Added a new machine: the Water Filtrator
- Converts 250 mB of Water into 1 Salt (25% chance) {Uses 2,000 RF}
- If combined with a Dense Net, gives a 35% chance to make 3 {Uses 3,000 RF and 500 mB} (Returns a regular net half the time)
- If combined with a Water Filter, gives 3 with a 50% chance to get 2 more, and returns a dirty filter {Uses 4,800 RF}
- If you instead give it 500 mB of Purified Water and a Water Filter, it will produce Ice Chunks, and returns a dirty filter {Uses 12,000 RF}
- Dirty Filters can be cleaned with water (anything with the listAllwater OreDict entry) in a crafting grid
Added a Combustion Generator recipe for Creepvine Seed Clusters


Increased the durability cost of the glass block solar cell recipe to 12 (was 7)
Re-balanced Studded Armour
- Now gives a tad less protection than Hardened Leather, but it lasts longer and gives armour toughness
Vanilla fish can now give Fish Oil (5% chance)
- Only 2 Fish Oil is required to make Lubricant now
Squid now have a chance to give Large Fish Fillets
Sharks and Whales now use more knife durability
Fixed my boosted planks recipes giving the wrong items
- Added one for Wither Logs (from Treasure2)
- Added one for Jungle Logs (since I forgot when making them)
Fixed Energy Outputs not using the correct items in their recipes
Increased the amount of durability crafting Neptunium gear uses



Replaced Anvil Fix with Anvil Patch - lawful
- Stupid mod dev went and deleted the 1.12.2 versions of the mod >:{


Added Additional Compression
Added Armor Underwear
- I've configured Better Diving's gear to accept insulation, but may change this later on (if it can be done the way I want to)
- All the other modded armours will also accept liners (that is kind of the point after all), with the only exception being ice and cloth armour
Added Difficulty Lock
Added Discord Rich Presence
Added Fluid Funnel
Added Ranged Pumps
Added Reskillable
- Various things are now locked behind certain skills (mainly gear and some machines/parts). I may change this later, but I like the idea of a skill tree you can unlock & progress through. (plus it makes all the XP rewards you get useful)
- I'll add more stuff in future updates as I plan them better

Added SimpleDifficulty
- Basically anything that's made with water can be drunk to restore thirst, as well as source blocks (shift+right-click them to do so)
- Harvestcraft's sodas have a 10% chance to give you the "thirsty" debuff
Added Water Control Extreme
