v1.0 Changelog:


Initial release.


Changes from test build 2.0:

Edited template world
- Part of the start area is now shallower so you can gather materials easier
- I've placed some creepvines, resources, and secrets around the place. Try to find them all ;D
Fixed early-game quests not being doable due to me breaking the research by accident (sorry)
Boosted a few quest rewards
Fixed my custom structures not spawning correctly
Added a new structure: Sea Temple (Small) by xdkiller1549: https://complex.ivorius.de/submissions/119


Tweaked speeds of most of the recipes in the Iron-Reinforced Centrifuge
Fixed multiple recipes not working due to a scripting oversight
Modular Machines now has its own research, and new recipes
Several Iron-Reinforced Centrifuge recipes can now accept Lava as an input, and get increased outputs
Added recipes to the Chef's Worktable


The recipe for Cooking for Blockheads II can now use a Kitchen Corner (or the previous counter)
Added 2 new Modular Machines:
- Combustion Generator: Converts burn time into RF. Sadly though, I can't configure it as much as I want to; so it's set to use coal's burn time (1600). Any extra will be lost.
- Energy Extractor: Extracts energy from various (mostly natural) resources. Currently supports fish, fish fillets (both kinds), ink sacs, creepvines (and their seeds), and acid mushrooms.
Both aren't that expensive, but should hopefully help alleviate the lack of power when you first unlock modular machines.
Acid Mushrooms should now properly generate (in new chunks)
Creepvines should now properly generate (in new chunks)
Seagrass should now properly generate (in new chunks)


Added several new recipes to the Recycler
- You can now recycle full sets of armour (vanilla, Hardened Leather, and Studded)
- You can now recycler a few tool-type items
Balanced out Bedrock Miner in a way I want
