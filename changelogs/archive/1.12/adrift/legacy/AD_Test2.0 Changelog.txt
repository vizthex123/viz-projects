Test Build v2.0 Changelog:


Updated the starting items
Tweaked Better Diving values for various items
Updated a few early-game researches to actually be possible
Blacklisted several items from Lootbags
Added 2 new Modular Machines:
- Recycler: Recycles items. Kind of in the name.
- Pulverizer: Currently does nothing, but will double ores & such
Tweaked the Alloy Furnaces' upgrade
- Machine Vent upgrade now increases speed by 25% (was double output items)
-- The same upgrade can now be applied to the Iron Reinforced Centrifuge.


Generated a new world for the template to use
- This one has a much deeper ocean, as well as some slight differences with the secrets and whatnot
Put a few bonus items into the raft chest
Tweaked spawning logic of Lycanite's Mobs

Tweaked Mineshaft spawnrates
Fixed how the starting inventory didn't have the correct items
Tweaked driftwood rarity, it should be more common now
Change Basic Worktable recipe, now uses 1 crafting table and 2 driftwood


Added recipes to smelt horse (called pet in-game) armour

Added the cobblestone OreDict entry to Moss Stone


Balanced out Pristeel armour

- Updated Fuel Canister config and tooltips to reflect this change
Added a recipe to smash a blaze rod into 4 Blaze Powder
- Locked it behind its own research. I want to expand upon it, but there's not really any other dusts or powders right now. It's optional (as several other researches are), but it'll help conserve resources.
Set all beds to have a burn time of 400
Added a burn time to Fire Charges (525)
Buffed Neptunium Sword damage to 12
Buffed Neptunium Boots & Helmet defense to 5, added 1 Armour Toughness to the chestplate and leggings (set now gives 24 defense and 10 toughness)
