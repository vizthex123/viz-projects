Made a better texture for the Advanced Wiring Kit
Started distributing some of the lore
- Some comes from quests, some found in the world, etc.
Plants from Better Diving should now properly generate
Multiple researches will now accept many more items
Tweaked Worley's Cave generation
- It should make them a bit more cave-like, but it also depends on how well the game generates new stuff in existing worlds


Solar Furnaces now heat you up
- Heats you up by 3 (regular furnace is 4 when active)
The recycling recipe for Power Cells now gives more Copper
Tweaked Lycanite's Mobs config
- This should (hopefully) help with the tickrate lag spikes, but it's not a guarantee.
Properly named the Bone Stick (oops)
Fixed some Artisan's Tools not being craftable
Removed my cobblestone tool material
- It was very useless, sorry for adding it


Reduced the durability of flint tools
- Now 50, was 75
A few recipes that should be hidden until later on are now hidden until later on
Changed the recipe for the Heat Exchanger
- Now locked behind the "Technology" and "Smithing" researches, and uses Pliers instead of a Solderer. Durability cost has been doubled.
- The existing solderer recipe is still avaliable, and is slightly cheaper, but requires an Engineering table.
The following researches now accept more items:
- Advanced Cooking
- Smithing
- Engineering
- Multi-Machines (was Modular Machinary)


Removed the hammer from the Machine Controller recipe
Several recipes will now accept both Gold Ingots, and Gold from Better Diving
The Machine Controller recipe now uses Copper instead of a Diamond or Emerald

Machine Casing now use Stone (or anything with the sediment OreDict entry) instead of a Block of Redstone
Swapped the durability costs for both Reinforced Casing recipes
Slightly tweaked the recipe for the Fuel Canister
The campfire from SimpleDifficulty now drops itself when broken
- Not sure why it doesn't do this by default, but oh well.
- Now gives +10 temperature instead of +7


Water Strainers now take slightly longer to catch items
- They also have a moderate chance to be empty, which helps balance them out quite a bit (the sea is rather large after all)
Changed the recipe for the Circuit (swapped Fibrous String for Silicon)
Changed the recipe for the Advanced Wiring Kit (changed Redstone to Circuit)
Reduced the RF gained from Creepvines, Creepvine Seed Clusters, and Ink Sacs
Increased the durability use of all recipes that use an Artisan's Carver

- Normal: 8,192/2,048
- Reinforced: 32,768/4,096
- Enabled the Big one, it's at 65,536/8,192
- Enabled the Huge one, it's at 131,072/16,384


Tweaked Fluid Funnels

- Funnels now take 3 seconds to transport fluids, and transfer 250 mB at once
- Taps now hold 50 mB of fluid

Added AtomicStryker's Battle Towers

Disabled Weather, Storms & Tornadoes for now
- A few (well, one) people on the Discord said that it causes a lot of lag


Removed Smooth Font
Removed Watercan
