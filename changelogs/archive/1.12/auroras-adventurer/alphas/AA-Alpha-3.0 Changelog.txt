A3.0 Changelog:

"Magical Flower" now accepts any regular Mystical Flower.

All* XP Rewards are now Team Rewards
- I haven't tested whether or not this gives more or less than I intend though. If it doesn, I'll have to add an XP Bottler mod and use those instead.
* Currently, one doesn't as you are supposed to have everyone collect their own amount of XP from the quest.

Added several new quests (I forgot to keep track lmao)
