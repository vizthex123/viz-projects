A5.0 Changelog:

Fixed duplication bug in "Starting Out"
"Shop Unlocking" now consumes items, as intended.
- This means you can submit a few at once and pay the rest later, if some Gold Nuggets are cluttering your storage. (Also since it's supposed to be a payment, it makes more sense)

"Mob Hunter I" now needs 30 kills instead of 25
Crafting Wither Skeleton Skulls from fragments now only needs 4

"Mining Opus" also accepts Mystical World's Amethyst Pickaxe (since they're identical)
- XP Reward auto-claims as intended

"Basic Housing" now accepts any coloured bed

Added 2 new tiers to LevelHearts - Level 35, and Level 50
- As soon as you  hit those levels (or if you're already there), you should get the extra hearts.

Tweaked Scaling Health's difficulty feature slightly
- Mostly small changes, but the maximum difficulty is now 100 instead of 250

Changed StatusEffectHUD to be in the bottom-right to prevent HUD conflicts with pinned quests
- You are free to move it to wherever you want though. (Just click Esacpe --> Mod Options --> StatusEffectHUD)

Added Curse of Binding to diamond armour gained from the Mob Hunter quests
- I'll try to do this for all armour sets rewarded from quests, to help make it seem like some type of trade-off
-- In addition, the full set is now rewarded upon completion of "Mob Hunter V" and Excalibur has been moved to "Mob Hunter IV"
--- Hlmet now has Respiration III instead of I

Creepers don't explode in a huge area and don't follow you no matter where you go now (basically they're back to normal except for the speed boost.)
- Due to the speed boost though, they may be hard to avoid.


MOD CHANGES:

Added Forestry (basically only because I love the backpacks)
Added Furnace Overhaul
Added Water Strainer
Added Shipwrecks!
Added Villager Market
Added Mo' Villages
Added Extra Utilities 2
Added Traverse: Legacy Edition
Added Dynamic Trees Traverse Compat
Added Traveller's Backpack
Added BetterBedrockGen
- I prefer XPlosion's Flat Bedrock, but it causes the tickrate to drop down to 2 so I had to remove it
Added Equipment Tooltips
- Added info quest for it too
Added The Lost Quiver
Added Charset Transport - Carts and Rails
- Added Charset Lib
Added Underwater Rails
Added Useful Railroads
- Added UTeamCore
-- Direction Rail is disabled in favour of Extra Rail's
--- Same for Telporting Rail, but that's due to it being weird & stupid to use. Until I can fix the Extra Rails' one, you can't teleport carts without some other mod or something.
Added Spark's Hammers

Disabled Teleporting Rail from Extra Rails
- I can't get it to work, oh well. Use the one from Useful Railroads instead.


Updated Classic Bar
Updated FTB Guides
Updated FTB Quests

Removed Simple Generators
- Since Extra Utils is included now, these are superfluous
Removed TreesofStages
- Wasn't useful since I doubt anyone is building a tree farm.

Deleted a few unused configs (really only *slightly* reduces space on disk)
