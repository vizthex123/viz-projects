B1.0 Changelog:

Added a recipe to smelt rotten flesh into leather

Returned Creepers to normal vanilla behaviour
- Except for the Scaling Health HP increase, they should be back to normal
-- I wanted to reduce the health cap for Creepers, but I can't. Sorry!

Made the armour awarded from hunting various enemies Chainmail instead of Leather

Reduced burn time of Solid Fuel from 40,000 (200 Items worth) to 4000 (2.5 Coal's)

Reduced the amount of Valuable Gemstones required in "Fragments of a Heart" to 2
- Added a quest similar to it for Scaling Health's Heart Crystals, required 12 XP Levels and 1 Valuable Gem to get 3 - 6 Fragments (since you need 9 per heart)

Added recipes to turn Heart Containers and Baubley Hearts' various hearts into Heart Dust (from Scaling Health)
- This allows you to turn excess hearts into healing items, since the maximum HP is set to 1,024

Added purchasing quest for Blue Hearts
- Since they're purely based on worldgen RNG, I figure being able to buy them is nice.
-- They require 1 Valuable Gem (Diamond, Emerald, or Amethyst) and 1 of each lower tier heart. You'll get 1 - 2.

Added way to buy difficulty changing hearts from ScalingHealth
- Enchanted (-25 diff) is more expensve than Cursed (+25 dif)

Heart Containers from Scaling Health no longer require XP to use

Changed a few quest rewards



MOD CHANGES:

Added NotEnoughScaffold
Added Torch Bandolier
- Added a recipe that uses Amethyst
Added Extra Bows
-- Added B.A.S.E
Added XP From Harvest
Added XP Ore
Added Ignition: Foundry
- This is because I can't get Embers to work (I'm leaving it installed though, in case someone out there knows how to get it working; and because I want to be able to make it work), so in order for people to still have Ore Doubling I'm adding this mod.
-- When I get Embers working, I might remove this mod. I will have a warning in the Changlog though.
Added Tinker's Construct
- Ore Doubling is DISABLED! (And the Smeltery Controller has a tooltip saying so)
-- This also nullifies the pickaxe crafting quests, so for the Diamond one you will get 3 Diamonds back as a reward. All of them now consume the Pickaxe.
Added Tinker I/O
- Removed Ore Crusher so that you have to use Foundry to double ores.
Added Tinker's JEI
Added Tinkering with Blood Magic
Added Tinkers Mechworks Fork
Added Construct's Armory
Added JEI Integration
Added Flux Networks
- This is currently the only form of RF Storage (except for Extra Utilities) in the pack. It can store a huge amount though, and works wirelessly.
-- Tweaked it a bit to have a nicer progression curve. Tooltips communicate this.
Added Solar Flux Reborn
Added Thermal Dynamics
Added Rock Candy
Added Just Another Rotten Flesh to Leather Mod
- Removed my custom recipe
Added Baubley Heart Canisters
- Added tooltips explaining how to get each one
Added HeartDrops
- Sometimes when a mob is killed (I want it to be 55%, but the mod won't let me), you'll get a Zelda-esque floating heart that will restore 2 HP (1 Heart's worth)
-- Increased maximum difficulty from ScalingHealth to 150
Added Champions
- This makes rare, powerful enemies spawn every so often.
Added Auto Ore Dictionary Converter
Added Large Ore Deposits
Added Thermal Expansion
- Added Thermal Innovation
-- Added Redstone Arsenal
--- Disabled Energy Cells & Ore Doubling system


Updated The Aurorian Mod
- Changed Aurorian Stone recipe since the bricks got removed
Updated FoamFix
Updated Classic Bars


Removed XP Tome
- For one from Thermal Foundation is better, so there's no need for the XP Tome
-- XP Tome quest changed to the Tome of Knowledge
Removed Tips
Revmoed Loading Tips
- Neither were being used.
Removed FTB Tutorials
Removed FTB Guides
- Both of these weren't being used, as I have been placing info in the quest descriptions.
Removed Industrial Renewal
Removed Furnace Overhaul
Removed Extra Alchemy
Removed ContentTweaker
- It's annoying to use and I think it's breaking a few things
Removed Crafting Station
- Tinker's adds the exact same block, so it was redundant


Removed Spark's Hammers
Removed MultiTool
- Both of these are redundant due to Tinker's Construct
Removed all Stages mods
- Not being used, probably never will
