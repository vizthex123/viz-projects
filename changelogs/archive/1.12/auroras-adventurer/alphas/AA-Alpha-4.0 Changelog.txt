MISC CHANGES:

Mod devs, YouTubers, FTB Team members, etc. from Headcrumbs don't spawn anymore
- You can re-enable this if you want, but I just personally find it annoying.
Heads drop randomly now from enemies
Players heads aren't dungeon loots anymore

You no longer start with a full set of Leather Armour
Hardened clay doesn't generate underground now
- If you want to re-enable this, go to fclayspawn.cfg and set the option to "true"
The first heart from Level Hearts now happens at Level 10 instead of 5
You can no longer use Ore Excavation with an empty hand
Skeletons now have a 10-tick (about half a second) delay between shots


Fixed Chainmail Helmet recipe
Creepers no longer become invisible when within 6 blocks of the player
After 2 minutes, graves no longer need a key
Ghostly Shape now lasts for 2:30 instead of 2 minutes
- It's also supposed to slow down fall speed, but I can't find the setting for that.
Undead mobs (zombies, skeletons, etc.) drop Grave's Dust 25% of the time instead of 10

Added bare skeleton of shop system, where you can sell a few dungeon loot items. I'll expand it as I find more "useless" items in my test world.
Made a basic questline for Psi
- Due to how flexible (and complicated) the mod is though, I probably won't make anything more than what's there already.

Added some more quests, there's currently 93
