v10.0 Changelog - Finality


I plan for this to be the final big content update (might do patches & whatnot) so I can fully finish this modpack. So, onto the content:


Should've added a button to the main menu that takes you to the Discord


Finished the Botania questline
- The mod has a ton of content, but the questline has covered the main ones so it's fine in my eyes
Finished the Elementaristics questline
- This mod is kind of like Thaumcraft combined with Botania and Ars Magica. Lots of content & lots of customizability, so there's only a few quests.
