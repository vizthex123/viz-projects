v5.0 Changelog - Equivalence

Changed Nether Uranium and Zinc to be processed in the Pulverizer, as intended
- Added them to the world generator


Buffed the set bonus of Wither Bone armour
- Now gives Strength II instead of I
Updated tooltip for the Heart Amulet


Updated a few quest descriptions
Added some items to Forestry's backpacks
Fixed me breaking the Hopper recipe (sorry)


Improved some quest rewards
Added a few more items to Forestry's backpacks
Tweaked loot fabricator items (Deep Mob Learning)


Doubled the default transfer rate of Flux Points & Plugs
Changed recipe for the Fueled & Powered Quarries
- Tweaked their costs, and added an alternate one for the Fueled Quarry
Changed the alternate recipe for the Quantum Quarry
- The Actuator stays the same
-- You can still use the Snowglobe one, but mine isn't super expensive, doesn't require you to hunt down biomes, and lets you upgrade a BuildCraft Quarry to a Quantum one


Expanded upon the Blood Magic questline
Added a Set Bonus to Living (+20 Armour Toughness) and Sentient (+100% Attack Damage) armour
Changed Black Quartz and Invar set bonus
- I noticed some bonuses were broken, and suspect this was the cause
-- The increased max HP effect I wanted doesn't work, so instead they do this:
Invar - +2 armour toughness
Black Quartz - +12% movement speed, +17% attack damage, wither effect removed 


Reduced recipe cost for all Flux Storages (Flux Networks)
Removed Diamond OreDict from Astral Diamond
- You can place it in a Numismatic Dynamo with Lapidary Calibration to get 5,000,000 RF
-- It still retains the gemValuable OreDict, but try not to use them since they're rare
Astral Diamonds can now spawn in the top floor of Battle Towers


Removed basic metal armours from Thermal Foundation
Started working on ProjectE questline
- Each of its add-ons will also have a group of quests in whatever section they're an add-on for
