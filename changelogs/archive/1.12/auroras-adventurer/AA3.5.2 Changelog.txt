R3.5.2 Changelog

Creepers shouldn't spawn as Champions anymore
- I find it annoying since they explode fairly quickly, so you don't really have time to kill them (it's a config option so feel free to re-enable it if you want)

Changed Crafting Runes, instead of decrafting into Bottle o' Enchanting, they now decraft into lower tier runes
- Since you can upgrade to the next tier, you should be able to downgrade as well. Common runes still give 1 Bottle o' Enchanting

Tweaked amount of Crafting Runes needed to make each Singularity
- Rarer runes need less to make a Singularity
-- Also fixed broken recipe for Distilled Luck

Slightly increased cost to mass craft 64 Chance Cubes at once

Changed recipe for Solar Panel VIII
- Doesn't need a Dragon Egg anymore. Having to do all of that just for a solar panel is too much work.

Singularity missions (except for the Ultimate one and a few others) don't consume the item anymore
- idk why it was set to consume the items, it shouldn't have been
Reduced cost for Mithril, Platinum, and Iridium singularities. Each only needs 500 of the item and 500,000 RF. Although the ingots aren't useful; 10,000 is a lot for a rare item.



Added MultiTools
- I like Paxels but Mekanism doesn't fit the modpack

Updated The Aurorian
Updated Roots
