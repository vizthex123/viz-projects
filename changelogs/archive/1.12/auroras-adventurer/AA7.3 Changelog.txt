v7.3 Changelog


Added tools & weapons from the Aurorian Mod to InvTweaksTree.txt
Should've made the recipe for Aurorian Steel more visible in JEI
Amazing Technicolour Glasses now sell for 1,000 Aurum
Added shops for Twilight Forest's various Charms
- They've been in the pack for awhile, but remained unfinished. You've got to complete "Magical Charms" to unlock them, in addition to "Exotic Goods Buyers"


Added a pattern chest as a reward to "A Proper Forge"
- It's a team reward, meant to store the casts you make
Replaced the plastic reward in "Power Storage & Transmission" with a Latex Processing Unit and Tree Fluid Extractor
- They're team rewards, and gives you a headstart on plastic production.
Fixed the recipe for Lavender Flour


Added an alternate recipe for Aurorian Glass that uses blue dye
Finally integrated AE2 with the early stages of other mods
- Currently integrates with Blood Magic, Botania, Actually Additions, The Aurorian, ProjectRed, Iron Chests, Wireless Redstone: ChickenBones Edition, RF Tools, and Mystical World
-- Note that several of the integrations are mere OreDict entries. Botania and Blood Magic hold the main content.
Changed recipe for ME Security Terminal
Removed ME Security Terminal reward from "Energistic Autocrafting"
- Replaced it with a 16k ME Drive, doesn't auto-claim anymore


Added Sky Stone Chests (both variants), non-coloured Shulker Boxes, and Ender Chests (vanilla) to the highlyAdvancedChest OreDict entry
Added a recipe to smelt Hardened Clay into Bricks
- Would've done Clay (block) -> Bricks, but the game didn't like that since there was already a smelting recipe for Clay (blocks)
-- Gives 4x the XP from making brick (item)


Removed the Pigiron recipe for Iron Toolkits
Re-balanced the recipes for Gold Toolkits
Ender Toolkits basic recipe now needs Reinforced Slates instead of the scrapIngot OreDict
Reduced cost of Dark & Red Matter furnaces
- Blocks replaced with items
