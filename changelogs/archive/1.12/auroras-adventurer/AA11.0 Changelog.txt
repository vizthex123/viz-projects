v11.0 Changelog:


Alright, I'm declaring this and all of my other 1.12 modpacks unsupported. I will fix any game-breaking issues, crashes, etc. if people report them - but I'm finally moving out of my rut and onto 1.16+. Mods for 1.12 aren't really being updated anymore, and newer mods have cool systems I'd like to use (plus, this pack is complete - so all I've been doing for the past few updates is bugfixes and minor tweaks).

Since the issue tracker is just the GitHub repository, I'll leave the label for this pack up - just in case people report more minor bugs that others may want to know about.

Thank you for downloading & playing this pack, and I hope you enjoy my newer ones as much as you enjoyed this.



Cleaned up all of the lore, as well as fixing typos in several entries.
- Also fixed how half of it wouldn't load in
The orange heart recipes have been transferred to the new yellow heart
- I'm personally not sure why the dev changed it (or even when it was changed), but whatever.

The Heart Amulet now uses any type of heart

Removed BetterBedrockGen
Replaced Bigger Crafting Tables with Extended Crafting: Nomifactory Edition
- It kept crashing the game, and since 1.12 mods as a whole have been abandoned, it's never getting fixed
- Recipes have been migrated to tables from Extended Crafting
- Extended Crafting's tables have been made cheaper to keep in line with how it was with Bigger Crafting Tables
