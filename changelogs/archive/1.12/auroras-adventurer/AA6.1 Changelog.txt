v6.1 Changelog


Fixed some typos
Fixed a few broken scripts
Moved dialogue from "Twilight Catalysts" to "The Twilight Realm"


Hid multiple technical items
Fixed a few broken quests & rewards
Changed the Chance Cubes in the Transmutation Table's recipe to Mana Pearls
- The Cubes were always placeholder, but I never could settle on an exact item to use; so I chose Mana Pearls.


Fixed the Tape Measure Reel recipe not using the OreDict
Fixed the Red Stone (Transmutation Stone from RetroExchange) not being consumed when it's supposed to
- Some of the recipe will make it take damage. The ones that consumes it are:
Transmutation Table & Tablet
Alchemical Algorithms
- Changed recipe to only use 1 Transmutation Stone
Philosopher's Stone (already consumed in v6.0)


Recipes where it gets damaged:
ProjectE Fuels - 5 base, doubles each tier. Zeitheron fuel is 50 damage.
Soul Talisman - 100 Damage per craft
Conjuration Assembler - 250 damage per craft
Transmutation Generator - 500 damage per craft
Transmutation Dissassembler - 500 damage per craft


The Transmutation Tablet no longer requires 1 Astral Diamond (all 4 slots use the gemValuable OreDict now)
Changed recipe for the Soulbound Talisman
The player now loses health upon death, but it can't go below your starting health (which is supposed to be 16, but stays at 12 for some reason)
- Implemented a work-around fix by gving you a few hearts upon spawning



Updated Aurorian Items (from v1.4 to v1.6)
