v3.1 Changelog - A Quick Fix

Buffed the rewards from "The Tower's Guardian"
Changed "Tribute" to be optional
- Swapped the dialogue so it matches the rest stylistically
-- Boosted reward to 20 XP

Moved the Arcane Workbench Covering reward to "Magical Crystals"

Fixed several bugs:

- Removed the items I had favourited (that was in my playtesting world and isn't meant to be there by default)
- Boosted portal frame requirement in "My Thanks, Adventurer" to 14 (like it's supposed to be)
- Restored InvTweaksRules to its default (having food in slot 1)
- Added Willow Wood Planks to the "plankWood" OreDict, so they can be used to make regular crafting tables and sticks
-- The quests reflect this by accepting regular variants of the items
