v2.3 Changelog - Small Content Update

Re-structured & completed The Aurorian questline
- You've got to go through the entire mods' progression before leaving now (don't worry it doesn't take all that long)
-- I'll expand it as the mod does, but for now it covers basically everything so I'm considering it completed.

Finished adding set bonuses for Actually Additions' armour
- Void Crystal, Emeradic, and Palis now have bonuses
-- Tweaked tooltips for bonuses added previously

Changed set bonus for Emerald armour
- Removed Haste effect, now gives Resistance II

Changed Leather set bonus to +10% Attack/Movement speed

Changed Cerulean armour set bonus to give Strength I instead of II

Removed my work-around quests and changed the order of the starting quests a tad

Fixed some broken quests
Swapped shapes of Shop & Boss Fight quests
- Pentagons are now shops, Octagons are now boss fights

Re-balanced spawnrates of coins in battle towers
Slightly reduced spawnrate of Battle Towers
Removed Stone Buttons from Battle Towers' loot table
Removed Stone tools from Battle Towers' loot table
Removed Fishing Rods from Battle Towers' loot table
Reduced spawnrate of Gold in Battle Towers

Added torches to Battle Towers' loot table

Starting difficulty is now 3
- This is because in the Aurorian (starting dimension) difficulty is reduced by 3, so these cancel out and make it 0 by default. Plus, you'll have some gear before heading to the Overworld so you should be able to handle things (and Aurorian enemies can't spawn as Champions, so you won't encounter any powerful foes unless you find a Battle Tower)

Removed (most) dev references as Champion names
Slightly reduced effect of Vortex affix

Added a recipe to convert Silentwood Sticks to regular ones
Added a recipe to decraft Cobwebs into 2 string each
Added a recipe to melt Aurorian Furnace Chimneys back into ingots
Added a recipe to melt Cups {The Aurorian} (I renamed them to "Cerulean Mug") to Cerulean

Added a set bonus to (basic) Wizard Armour
- I might add some for the others later, but for now it's fine

Changed droprate of Red Hearts to 3%

Added Crystal (The Aurorian) to Lapidary Calibration (worth 50k RF)
- Renamed it to "Aurorian Crystal"
Reduced Magic Crystals (Electroblob's Wizardry) to 15k RF each

Removed water breathing potions from recipes for Diving Suit
- The pre-enchanted ones still need it, but only the short version

Increased the arrow capacity of the Basic Alchemical Quiver to 72 (was 40)
- Reduced maximum potion capacity to 1,250 mB
-- They all scale based on this, so the rest have been changed as well

Fixed the bug where Backpacks (Forestry) didn't pick up items they're supposed to

Finished Electroblob's Wizardry questline
- A lot of the mod content is about customizing your wand and playstyle and such, so I'll leave that up to the player

Started working on the "The End" questline
Started working on the "Enemy Simulation" questline



Added The Mushroom Oak to the world generator - https://complex.ivorius.de/submissions/73

Added Worley's Caves
- This brings variety to caves while also not making them massive
Added More Loot Tables
Added Game Stages
Added Recipe Stages
Added Item Stages
Added Bloodmoon
- Set them to have a 7% spawn chance, and tweaked the min/max spawnrate, range, etc.

Removed Customized Dungeon Loot
- It doesn't work the way I thought it would, rip
Removed Just Another Rotten Flesh to Leather Mod
- Food Expansion adds an item and recipes to do this, so I've modified those to work as I want them to
