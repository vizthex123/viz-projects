v7.1 Changelog - Slight Balancing


Reduced EMC of Aurorian Cobblestone to 1
- This was intended from the start, but I misclicked when setting its EMC
Fixed inaccurate tooltip on Aurorian Chimneys
Added a tooltip to Silkworm Eggs conveying their use to make String


Reduced the level requirements for the last 2 hearts
- Now at levels 90 and 100 instead of 95 and 110
Improved wording on Cerulean Arrow tooltip
Several quests are now hidden until you unlock them


Added XP Rewards to "The Overworld's Metals" and "Technological Components"
Changed arrow reward in "Basic Ranged Combat" to Cerulean Arrows
Fixed the Silentwood Log -> Sticks recipe being broken
Added an alternate recipe for the Iron Chest Transporter using Cerulean and Silentwood Sticks


Changed EMC of all slimeballs to 48
Re-balanced the chances of various qualities to spawn
- Positive ones should appear a bit more often than the negative ones
-- Things related to magic shielding will spawn a bit less often (since they're kind of pointless)


Webs can no longer be excavated
Hopefully boosted mob spawning in the Darkstone Dungeon enough to make it an actual dungeon, instead of just a boss fight after a maze
Added a new lore entry for the Moon Acolytes
Added a custom recipe for Lavender Flour & Bread


Elder Guardians now always spawn as Champions
"Tribute" quest is no longer optional
- It unlocks the final quest in the Aurorian questline (which is required), so it should be a requirement as well.
Fixed "Basic Tinkered Tools" not detecting items
- Same for "Ranged Tinkering", "Metal Tinkered Tools", and "Advanced Tools"
Fixed "Tool Forging" not detecting all the forges


Updated Aurorian Items
