v4.0 Changelog

Added a new lore entry about Wither Skeletons and the curse that causes them to become that.
Added some more Champion names & suffixes
Boosted recipe value of Chance Cubes

Should've removed structure generation in The Aurorian
- It gives you very early access to some powerful gear, which is kind of unbalanced
-- I've noticed that the configs sometimes just ignore my changes though, so it depends
--- Battle Towers still spawn because I have no way of stopping that. I did incorporate that in the lore though, but it would be nice if I could at least change the loot for the dimension

Changed multiple values for Lapidary Calibration
Added lots of items to the Numismatic Dynamo

Fixed a few exploits
Added 3 recipes for the Creative Modifier (from Tinker's Construct)
Fixed a couple recipe conflicts

"Shop Orders" now requires you to leave The Aurorian before being able to unlock it
Re-balanced amount for string shop orders
Added a one-time shop for Aurorian Glass
- Pretty much only because I don't want to go through a bunch of hassle just to get 1 thing I need for 1 item, plus at that point coins are kind of useless yet you have quite a few

Moved page 4 of "The Last Refuge" to "The Dungeon's Guardian"
- Renamed its lore category to "The Last Refuge"

Added profiles to Inventory Tweaks, by default there are 2: The default one, and the one I use.
- There's a quest covering how to swap between them as well
Added multiple food items to the "edibleFood" tag in InventoryTweaks
- Mostly from the Aurorian Mod

Fixed the thank you message for "The Dungeon's Guardian" not using the proper formatting
Moved the lore about Blood Moons to "Better Tools"
- They don't occur in the Aurorian dimension so it feels out of place. Honestly I want it to automatically be given after finishing a Blood Moon, but that isn't possible
Renamed "Slay the Cultists" to "Cultist Culling"

Fixed Akashic's dialogue in "The Temple of the Moon"
- Added another one that tells you what to do

Added a tooltip for how to get Crystalline Shields (explains the process for all of them)
- Just in case someone is wondering how to get it and/or any other Crystalline gear
Added tooltips for how to get Aurorianite items

Re-did the lore of "The Last Refuge (all pages)
- Added more details and re-organized the structure. Their quest placements are mostly the same though. (I try to place each page somewhere that sort of connects it to the topic of that page)

Removed all the Thermal Foundation sickles
Buffed Knight's Armour drops
- It's a bit more common, and can drop from Tier 2 champions; and will be enchanted when it drops

Changed smelting values for Knight Armour
- Each piece gives Iron equal to half the cost of regular craftable armour (eg the Chestplate gives 4 ingots)

Added an optional quest to make a Scrapper
- I advise making one if you're still trying to get Aurorian Steel, as it gives twice the output of the furnace recipe for a fairly cheap cost

Added some extra drops to Deep Mob Learning's Data Models
- Mostly coins and the like
-- I did this because you really don't need 86 stacks of Rotten Flesh and such. In the future, I'd like to add craftable boxes of loot for each enemy
Buffed reward of "Gifting a Diamond Necklace"
Reduced alchemical quiver arrow capacity to 60
- Increased fluid capacity to 3,000 mB (enough for 60 arrows, if completely filled)


Updated The Aurorian


Added Tinker's Addons
- Changed recipes for the bonus modifier items
