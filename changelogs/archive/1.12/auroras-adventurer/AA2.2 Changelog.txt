v2.2 Changelog - The Balance Update

Finally dropped the "REV" from all updates
- I consider this project officially revived now

Added a set bonus for Wither Bone armour
Removed stat buffs from Emerald armour
- It only gives the potion effects now

Started making set bonuses for crystal armours (Actually Additions)
- Restonia, Palis, and Diamantine are implemented. I plan to add the rest next update.

Re-balanced both flux armour set bonuses

Reduced spawnrates of battle towers
Added Fire Charges and both Golden Apples to Battle Towers' loot table
Added all of Actually Additions' crystals to Battle Towers' loot table
- Regular ones will spawn uncommonly from floors 4 - 8
-- Empowered ones can spawn rarely on the top 2 floors (9-10)
--- Both varieties can be picked up by the Adventurer's Backpack (Forestry)
---- Added Enchanted and Cursed hearts to the loot table for Battle Towers (top floor only, and they're somewhat rare)

Reduced min/max amount of Coins inside battle towers

Finished implementing "Alloyed Armour" quest
Finished implementing "Gem Encrusted Armour" quest
Added a new quest to gather Nether armour
- As with the others, it's optional

Reduced maximum health of the player to 100 (50 Hearts)
- Anything past this makes you basically immortal. Especially with the variety of armour/enchantments you can get

Added several items to the Adventurer's Backpack whitelist
- Tweaked a couple others as well

Removed Enchanted Books from the Champion loot table
- You get way too many all the time, idk why

Tweaked Bountiful config
Added a few recipes
Fixed broken recipes for Blue Heart Canisters

Reduced droprates of Scaling Health's heart canisters by half
- Passive mobs can no longer drop them
-- You must use 5 XP levels to use a container
--- The healing received is 50% more effective

Overhauled difficulty modifiers: (Scaling Health)
Note that higher difficulties give greater rewards, and you can buy/find Enchanted/Cursed hearts to combat that

The game starts at a difficulty of 1
Nothing is changed when you die (previously it went up by 0.25 per death)
Maximum difficulty is now 250 (was 150)
Every boss kill makes you lose 1 difficulty (I believe it only counts vanilla ones though, hopefully I can add custom bosses)

Blight enemies have invisibility

Dimension-specific:

Difficulty increases twice as fast in the Deep Dark
- In addition, there is a flat bonus of 1 applied. So if you enter at difficulty 5, the game acts as if the difficulty is 6

Difficulty increases 25% faster in the Nether
Difficulty increases twice as fast in The End
Difficulty increases 32% faster in the Hunting Dimensions

While in the Daedalus Labyrinth, difficulty is increased by 7. Better find a way out fast.

Difficulty is lowered by 3 while in The Aurorian (lore-wise, because of the queen's magic and guards protecting it)
Difficulty is only 90% as effective while in the Twilight Forest
Difficulty is only 80% as effective while in the Aether
