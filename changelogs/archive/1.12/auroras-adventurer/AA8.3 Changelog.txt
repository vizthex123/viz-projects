Re-enabled Canyon and Crag Cliffs from Traverse
Removed Extra Utils Crusher > Pulverizer recipe
Fixed alternate Dimensional Shard recipe using the wrong Slate
Improved wording on Crafting Co-Processor tooltip
Fixed recipe order of the ME Interface


Swapped amounts given for Chaos Essence recipes
- RF costs have also been switched around
Increased Will requirement & use for Body Essence
- Now requires 150 minimum, and drains 100
Added a recipe to strip NBT data from Nether Stars
- Basically only because Chance Cubes gives me the stupid North Star reward 95% of the time and it's annoying


Re-enabled the Redstone Engine and Wooden Kinesis Pipe (BuildCraft)
Added JEi info on how to get each P2P tunnel (Applied Energistics 2)
Removed my unnecessary Signalum -> Resonant Fluxduct recipe
Removed unnecessary shapeless recipe for the Black Hole Controller v2.0 (Industrial Foregoing)
Added multiple items to the Protein Reactor
Added Aurorian trophies to the Enervation Dynamo
- Runestone gives 50k RF, Spider Mother gives 75k, Moon Queen gives 100k
-- I added this because I have to go back to get more scrap ingots every so often, but the trophies are useless after getting the first one. Plus, it can provide at least a small incentive to kill the bosses.
Added Twilight Forest trophies to Enervation Dynamo

Halved item cost of both Mystical (Shiny Golden) Apple recipes
Reduced spawnrate of Battle Towers in the Overworld
- They also now only spawn in 2 biomes in the Aurorian: Weeping Willow Forest, and Aurorian Forest

- RF required has been slightly increased (from 50k to 55k)

- The entry is actually used now! In the recipe for the Black Hole Unit
Tweaked multiple scripts
- Mostly just changing the way recipes are loaded so items don't have 4 separate ones
Hid a few debug items from JEI
