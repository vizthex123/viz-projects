R3.5.4 Changelog

Removed duplicate Alloy Furnace (Foundry) recipes
Increased durability of all Paxels and Universal Tools

Disabled the Great Wall world type
- It doesn't work at all with this modpack's progression & theme, so I don't want people to think they can use it

Changed the recipe for the Quantum Quarry (and reduced the amount of RF it uses per operation from 25,000 to 5,000 [might change later])
- Requires a regular BuildCraft one instead of the Snow Globe (and since that was the only use for the Snow Globe, it's been disabled)

Tweaked some quests (rewards, shapes, descriptions, etc.)
Added WIP info to several questlines
Added a final quest - crafting a Command Block
- It's incredibly expensive (naturally), and is technically the "ultimate goal"; but truly completing the back is finishing every quest (except the shop ones since they're repeatable)

Boosted recipe output of Solar Panel VII and VIII (gives 2 per craft like the other recipes do)

Added shop for Ender Pearls
- They can be bought (in groups of 1 or 2) for 1 Valuable Gemstone, or 16 XP Levels. Might change the prices later, but it depends

Changed recipe for Mixed Seeds 
- It now uses 4 of any seed (instead of just some due to an OreDict glitch), and can be crafted in the 2x2 crafting UI, and directly turns into Toasted Seeds (which are edible)
-- This is because I see these items as a way to quickly make some food if you're stranded out in a field or something, but their crafting recipes don't make sense if that is their intended purpose
--- You can also use 8 seeds and a piece of coal (in a shaped recipe) to make 4 Toasted Seeds at once. In case you find some underground or something.

Added Simple Quarry
- This was supposed to be added awhile ago, but I guess I forgot or it didn't download properly.
-- The Powered Quarry serves as a mid-tier quarry, roughly equal to the BuildCraft one (which comes before the Quantum Quarry)
--- The Fueled Quarry is an early-game Quarry, attainable after getting some Ender Pearls

Updated The Aurorian
