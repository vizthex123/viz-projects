v5.2 Changelog - Balance Patch


Tweaked several recipes to make them more balanced
Fixed a few recipes I broke
Finished the ProjectE questline
- I'll add some bonus quests to gather lots of EMC later down the road
Finished "The Ancient Void" (questline for the end)


Added Equivalent Additions

Removed Bountiful
- It's really not useful. Villages are sort of uncommon, and you get plenty of money from enemy drops and quests
