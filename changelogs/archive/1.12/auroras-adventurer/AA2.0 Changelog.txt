R1.0 Changelog:

First official release! Woo-hoo!!

Increased amount of random bonus Hearts in "Heart of Blue" by 1
Added new quest to sell 16 Common Runes at once.

Changed progression for AE2
- Controller now needs a few magical items

Difficulty changes based on the dimension you're in
- In the Nether, it's 75% the usual
-- In The End, it's 150% (1.5x) the usual
--- More will be added later

Unhide Foundry's (and Forestry's) refractory capsules from JEI

Added recipes to upgrade Crafting Runes to higher tier ones
- Removed the quest to sell 16 common ones at once
-- You use 4 of the lower tier to make 1 higher tier. So 4 Uncommon Runes make 1 Rare Rune.
--- Renamed them to make it seem like they're some sort of ancient tablets. (added tooltips about their rarity)
---- In addition, the first letter of the name of each Rune corresponds to their rarity.

Reduced the amount of XP gained from "Mob Hunter V" to 12 Levels

Fixed special Diamond armour set from "Mob Hunter V" having the wrong enchantments

Increased Chance Cube reward from "Basic Housing"
- Now gives 2 - 4 instead of just 1

Renamed "Ancient 'Uaeh' Rune" to "'Ancient 'Uy'yeh'* Rune"
* Pronouced oo-yeh

Changed "Shop Unlocking" to use 1 Block of Gold
- This is because you can buy a lot of things (and gold is semi-useless)

Renamed "Building Storage" to "Supply Storage"

Changed "Urn Payments" reward table: Now gives the choice of 6 XP Levels, a Block of Iron, or 4 Gold Ingots (was previoulsy 6 Levels, 4 Iron Ingots, or 2 Gold Ingots)

Fixed a few typos (both in quests and in renames/tooltips)

Reduced amount of creeper kills needed to complete "Creeper HUnter I" to 5 (from 10)

Changed Level Hearts progression (Now it's +1 Heart at levels 20, 25, 30, 40, 45, 50, and 60)

Increased chance of a golden heart from HeartDrops being dropped

Added basic quests for TInker's Construct
- I'll add more later; but for now there's enough to teach you the basics

Removed Laser Gun from PlusTiC
- Boosted Katana's damage bonnus to 2x  instead of the default 1.25x

Changed the progression of unlocking the "Electrical Engineering" questline
- Moved "Basic Power Generation" to the "Electrical Engineering" questline
-- "Machine Frames" is now located in "Starting Out"
--- All quests (except 1) in "Electrical Engineering" require you to complete "Basic Power Generation"

Added a recipe for Flux (form Flux Networks) using Ancient Runes
- It's 1 Legendary, 4 Rare Runes and 4 Uncommons to make 24 Flux

Rebalanced storage & transfer values for all Flux Networks storages
- They can all transfer 15% of their maximum capcity.
-- The capacities are (lowest ---> highest tier): 1,000,000 (back to the default); 5,000,000; 10,000,000 (remember as well you can have multiple cells)
--- Trasnfer rate: 150,000; 750,000; 1,500,000

Removed Energy Cells from Thermal Expansion
- This forces you to use Flux Networks as storage. I might add a recipe later that uses special quest-only items though.


MOD CHANGES:

Added Applied Energistics 2
Added ExtraCells2
- Added Just Enough Energistics (JEE)
-- Added shop for Charged Certus Quartz
Added Deep Mob Learning
- This allows you to make mob farms that don't rely on RNG spawns, and does so in a way that helps prevent lag
Added CleanView
- Some things give permanent potion effects, and I find it annoying to have particles 24/7. Feel free to disable or rmeove it if you want the particles back.
Added PlusTiC
Added Exchangers
Added OptiFine



Updated The Aurorian Mod (there were like 5 versions released while I was making this updated, calm down)
Updated Fantastic Lib
Updated FTBLibrary
Updated ConnectedTexturesMod
Updated Classic Bars
Updated Forge Endertech


Removed Scaffolding Block
- Idk why I didn't do this earlier


Disabled Rough Mobs
- Scaling Health adds a lot of difficulty already; and this modpack isn't meant to be Dark Souls: Minecraft Edition
