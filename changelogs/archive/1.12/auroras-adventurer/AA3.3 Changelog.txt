v3.3 Changelog - A Quick Fix

Fixed Recurrent Complex config formatting
- My tester found that it was formatted wrong and sent me the fix

Added a recipe to craft Bedrock Bricks, and a quest to submit them
- Don't use them for building of course, as you can't mine them in Survival.

Updated icons of all "Kill X Enemies" quests
Fixed a few quest descriptions

Finally fixed the Loot Fabricator recipe! Now it uses the OreDict, as intended

Removed the tooltip stating the Giant Crafting Table was unused

Fixed a few quest descriptions/rewards
