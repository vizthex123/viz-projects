v9.0 Changelog - Natural Aetheria

Replaced the Dark Modern GUIs texture pack with Unity: Dark Edition
- This keeps the nice dark theme UI, while also fitting better with the Unity texture pack


Finished the Botania (Natural Magic) questline
- There's a few more things I could add, but it covers the basics so it's fine for now
Finished the Aether: Legacy questline
- Most of it is optional since the core progression isn't super long, but does convey more lore than other questlines


Re-named a couple quests, re-did some rewards
Changed the placement of a few questlines, to (roughly) reflect their placement in the progression of the modpack


Disabled Aether: Legacy menu swap button
- Feel free to re-enable it if it's your preferred menu though
