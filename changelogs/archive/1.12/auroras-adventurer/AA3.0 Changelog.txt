v3.0 Changelog - Lore & Content

Finally fixed Lore Expansion! Thanks to the developer for helping me.
I've overhauled the current lore entries, and added a bunch more.
I don't think it's quite as much as I want in the final build, but it should be sufficient for the time being.

My tester found that attack speed does nothing since I have the incredible stupid & pointless combat cooldown disabled, so all set bonuses that affect it have been re-balanced

There was also a power outage while I was working on this, and that corrupted most of the quests; so I had to download v2.3.1 and work off of that.


Changed Flux Networks, and added some alternate recipes for Flux

Difficulty is now increased by 100 while in the Deep Dark, and increases 5x as fast; to fit the lore better
Finished questline for Deep Mob Learning

Hopefully fixed broken Chance Cubes config
Buffed the reward from "A Copy of Your Experiences"
Re-balanced Life Essence recipes
- Added another one that can be made in a Tier 2 Blood Altar

Re-balanced recipes for Netherending Ores
Increased base Quiver fluid storage from 1,250 to 2,000
Increased base Quiver arrow storage from 72 to 80
- These changes double the default arrow and potion storage
-- Since ranged combat is a focus of the modpack, I feel it's only fair to buff the Quiver this way (I might re-balanced it later though)
--- Note that each arrow imbued uses 50 mB of potion fluid (allowing you to shoot half of the stored arrows as imbued ones)

Increased the enchantment levels of all armour sets made with Empowered crystals to 3
- The only exception is Aqua Affinity, as it only has 1 level

Added Astral Diamonds to the Diamond and Valuable Gem OreDict
- I have no idea what they're used for in the mod, so I just did this. Of course you are free to choose what to do with them.
Nerfed Set Bonus for Emerald Armour
- Now gives Resistance I instead of II
Slightly reduced spawnrate of Actually Additions' crystals in Battle Towers

Removed my changes to Aurorian Coal's recipes
Changed ME Drive upgrade recipe
- The recipe is the same, but now it accepts Diamond/Crystal/Obsidian Chests or an ME Drive

Slightly boosted output of Chance Cube recipes when made in a Bigger Crafting Table
- Also added a recipe to make the Icosahedron with a regular crafting table
Tweaked extra spawnrate of Champions added by difficulty

Added the 2 alternate swords to the list of items accepted by the Tinker's quests
Added other basic metals to the list for "Advanced Tools"

Added various smelting temperatures to items I've added smelting recipes for
- I meant to that when I added the recipes, and forgot
Reduced the amount of iron you get from Drill Cores
- idk why it was so high

Properly removed the Diamond and higher furnaces
Added recipes to melt down the iron and gold furnaces into 6 of their component

Finished adding set bonuses for nether armour

Added a few enemies to the list of accepted enemies for Data Models
- They're just variations of the same enemy from other mods

Changed the way all of the quest rewards where the queen (and other characters) thank you work
- Now it uses /tellraw instead of /say, so the [Server] part isn't there. And it's coloured aqua for the queen, gray for Akashic, red for Forgebrow, and blue for Oseille
-- I may have missed a couple, so please tell me if so
Added Crystal Flowers, Mystical Flowers, Terra Spores, all Wooden Planks, and Wildroots to the Forester's Backpack accepted items list



Replaced Worley's Caves with YUNG's Better Caves
- Worley's Caves are near-identical to those of The Aurorian, and I want them to have at least some variety

Added YUNG's Better Mineshafts

Updated Forge Endertech
Updated RPG-Hud
Updated Simply Jetpacks 2
Updated The Aurorian

Removed Deep Resonance
- It's easily outclassed by other mods
Removed Potion Rings
- It's kind of pointless
