R3.4 Changelog:

Reduced the cost of the Wireless Charger
- It doesn't need an energy cell anymore. Replaced with Redstone Dust
--- Range reduced to 15 (note that is a radius not a diameter)

Finished Jetpack quests
- If you've already crafted the previous tiers, you can use admin tools to mark the quest as complete (look up how)
Tweaked Flux Pack charge rates
- Each one charges faster, and their output is 1/3 of their input speed

Boosted amount of items in "Box of Assorted Rewards"
Fixed rewards from "Magical Leaf-Eater"

Both Hearts now change difficulty by 5 instead of 10
- Shop costs (XP only) are cheaper
-- Stacksizes changes to 5

Reduced health bonus from LevelHearts
- Only gives 5 Hearts (+10 HP) total, at the following XP levels (once per player, per world):

5
10
20
25
30

Re-added regular recipe for Quartz Fiber (I didn't mean to remove it oops)

Added a recipe to craft 8 Rudimentary Snares at once using Gold
Changed "Extra Item Storage" to accept other backpack-style items


Replaced PlusTiC with Moar Tinkers
- For some reason PlusTiC's page of CurseForge doesn't exist anymore so I can't use it in my modpack

Added HelpFixer
Added Login HP Fix
Added Extended Crafting
- Currently unused, but I plan to add some recipes to it soon
Added Hunting Dimension
-  Difficulty is 1.5x (150%) more effective in this dimension
-- Only hostile mobs will spawn, and they have a 50% chacne to drop 2.5x the normal amount of XP, and always act like Looting I was applied on death
--- Mobs have 15% more attack & health than normal (and 6 extra armor). This can be furthur increased by the current difficulty
---- Positive potion effects (strength, resistance, etc.) will wear off twice as fast
