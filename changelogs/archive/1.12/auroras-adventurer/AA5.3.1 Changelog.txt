v5.3.1 Changelog - v5.3 Hotfix 1


Slightly tweaked Quality Tools' config
Slightly tweaked Simply Jetpacks' config
Tweaked the damage of Aurorian Steel items


Slightly increased speed of Iron & Gold furnaces
Actually disabled some items from Blood Arsenal
- It's just the divinity sigil and item to craft it, which are already unobtainable since they need a Tier 6 altar


Updated some tooltips
Tweaked a few quest rewards
Expanded the Blood Magic questline
Expanded the ProjectE questline

The Dark Modern GUIs and Unity texture packs are now included with the modpack
- I couldn't find whether or not I'm technically allowed to do that, but based on the license they use it should be fine. If the devs tell me not to though, I'll remove them.

Added CraftPresence
Added Aurorian Items
- This is a mod I made to add a few things because ContentTweaker hates me
-- Changed "Gifting a Diamond Necklace" to use the mods' necklace item


Removed DefaultOptions
