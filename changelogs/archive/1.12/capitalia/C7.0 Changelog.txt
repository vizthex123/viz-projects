v7.0 Changelog


Removed OreStages
- It's rather annoying to not be able to see higher-tier ores until you unlock their tier.
-- They're still locked behind Item Stages though, so you will need the research to process them

Updated ResearchTable to Alpha 1.0.0
- There may be some instability; but I think it's good enough to be included. I do hope it becomes the new stable build soon though.

All research to now uses the new tab system!
- If you're in the Discord server; you may have seen this in the #modpack-updates channel
-- This makes the entire research UI more organized and aesthetically pleasing.
--- Due to this, unavailable research is now no longer hidden. This allows you to plan ahead (and see how much work you have cut out for ya)
Added a new Military Research Disk, used to unlock weapons & ammo


You can now research the Space Age, but there are still no quests for it as of yet.
Added a new liquefied version of research
- Due to higher-tier things not needing low-tier data disks, I've added a system to liquify all the disks and use that liquid to make higher-tier disks.
-- Requires the Machine Age since you need a Magma Crucible and Fluid Transposer
