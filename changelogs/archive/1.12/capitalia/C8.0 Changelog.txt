v8.0 Changelog


Fixed a "bug" that caused Machine Frames to be uncraftable
- Not a real bug since I did it and overlooked the change though
You should be able to actually process ores (in the Enrichment Chamber) now


Ender Stars and Enhanced Ender Ingots are actually sellable now
(Regular) Golden Apples can now be sold for $300
Ender Ingots can now be sold for $350
- Also added a mass-crafting recipe in the Ender Crafter (similar to the one for Black Iron) {takes 20 seconds to craft}
Black Iron can now be sold for $25
- May change next update since I can't settle on a balanced price


Reduced the maximum RF capacity of the Quantum Compressor to 5,000,000
Reduced the mining speed of Steel tools to 8, Paxel to 8.25
Reduced the damage of Steel swords to 9.5
Buffed the durability of Diamond tools to 1,225


Added a burn time to saplings that didn't have them
Increased the sell price of Limestone Bricks to $3
Increased the RF storage of Golden Jetpacks to 22,500
Fixed the "Oil Processing" research being mislabeled and using the wrong fluid


Added alternate recipes to the Culinary Generator that uses Beets or Barley, and accepts Cooked Salmon
Re-enabled Iron Hammers & Excavators (Thermal Foundation)
Reset the Fueled Quarry to 64 blocks/1 Coal (1600 Burn Time)
- This is due to it mining an area of 256 blocks at once. I'd like 1 coal to mine 1 quarter of 1 layer of 1 chunk, that way it's cheap enough to warrent the investment; but not so good that you don't want to upgrade


Staged a few leftover Refined Storage items
"Machine Age" research now requires the Advanced Circuitry research
Fixed how basic and advanced circuits (Advanced Rocketry) couldn't be crafted when intended
Updated a few quests, item stages, etc.

Several items can be now melted in a Crucible


Staged all the upgrades from Simple Quarry behind the Iron Age
Staged the Fusion Reactor behind the Atomic Age
Increased the burn time of Red Coal to 2,000 (10 items)
Changed the "Electric Mining" quest to use a Fluxbore
Reduced the cost of Industrial Data Disks by 1 Steel Ingot
Reduced the cost of Oil Processing to 500 mB of Fluid Research


The Wireless Power Transmission research now costs 1,000 mB of Fluid Research instead of 8 industrial & 4 machine disks
Replaced the Atomic & Information Disks for the Basic Reactor research with 2,000 mB of Fluid Research
The Advanced Circuitry research now only needs 12 basic circuits
Reduced the Information Pad cost of the Atomic Age to 4
Essence (of Knowledge) can now be used to crate Fluid Research
You can now infuse Protons and Electrons to get Atomic Data Models
- The Fluid Research cost varies each time


Added value tooltips to multiple items that were missing them
Forge Energy now sells for 1 Cent per unit (so every 10,000 RF sells for $500)
Various gemstones can now be sold
Quarries (powered and higher) & Diamond Miners can now be sold

Increased the mining speed of the Steel Pickaxe to 8.5, Paxel to 9

The Diamond Jetpack now uses 30 RF/t (was 25)
Swapped research costs for Jacketed & Elemental ammo (and location in the UI)
Reduced cost of AP Shells to 6
Increased cost of Advanced Rounds research to 8

Reduced Stone to 1 mB of Fluid Research


Re-did some balance stuff
Added a recipe to make Hardened Glass in the Alloy Furnace
Massivley reduced the power gen gained from the gas-burning generator
