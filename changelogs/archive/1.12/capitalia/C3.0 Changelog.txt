C3.0 Changelog - Basic Restructuring Finished


Introduced a new item: Data Disks! You need to craft these to research things now. They're made by compressing items in a Quantum Compressor, or crafting things together (depending on the tier).
- The Compressor's recipe has been changed so you can build it in the Iron Age
- The Heat Generator is now gated behind the Iron Age


All the planned restructuring is now done!
Note that this doesn't mean the content is done, but the overall progression & feel of the pack is finished


I've made a series of tutorial videos as well, if you would like to get some tips & tricks:

Buffed the amount of blocks a Simple Quarry can mine
- It's now twice as efficient (1 coal breaks 32 blocks instead of 16)
Changed the recipe for the Fueled & Powered Quarry
- Changed the name of the Powered Quarry to "Basic Electrical Quarry"
-- It's now staged behind the iron age
Added quests for all the quarries


Basic tools no longer force you to use Foundry to craft them
- This is due to the re-structure of the research I did. It's still cheaper to make them with Foundry though.
-- Armour still requires you to use Foundry, as do Steel tools


Fixed AP Shell & Rounds research having broken requirements
Split Lumium shells & ammo into 2 branches
- Components are now unlocked in each one's game stage
All weaponry research now also locks the recipes until they've been researched
Fixed some incorrect tooltips
The Research Table now uses any kind of stone


Added torch reward to "Basic Mining" quest
Fuel Canisters now require Bronze
Stone Conveyors are now staged behind the Stone Age
Added a Crucible Table recipe for Overworld Quartz ore
Increased the melting temperature of the basic crucible to 1,225K
- This is so you can melt down bronze with the basic crucible, as intended; albeit slowly at first


Changed the recipe for the Mirror (Solar Flux) to use Bronze
Evened out Paxel durability to be multiples of 25
Removed the recipe for Forge Microblocks' Stone Rods, they now turn into Stone Sticks

Boosted sell price of Polished stones
Boosted sell price of Sandstone
Added recipes for Steel Plates


Adjusted defense & damage of Steel
Boosted powergen amounts for Mekanism generators
- The config uses their Joules instead of FE or RF, so it's annoying to try and fine-tune it. Be prepared for later changes.
Removed the custom Yellorium & Iridium dusts I made
- I forgot they already existed lol

Replaced DiscordSuite with DiscordRichPresence


Added Ore Stages
- Various ores are now staged based on when you can obtain/use them
Added Bedrock Ores
Added Large Ore Deposits
- Customized every ore vein, removed unused ones, and added one for Yellorite & Peridot
Added CoralReef
Added Custom Main Menu
- For now, it's unused; but I plan to make a factory-themed menu.




Updated RandomPatches
Updated UniDict
Updated WanionLib
Updated YUNG's Better Mineshafts


Removed Barrels, Drums, Storage & More
- Other mods do the same thing better, so this one is now obsolete. The barrel quest has been changed to a cache.
