v13.0 Changelog:


Alright, I'm declaring this and all of my other 1.12 modpacks unsupported. I will fix any game-breaking issues, crashes, etc. if people report them - but I'm finally moving out of my rut and onto 1.16+. Mods for 1.12 aren't really being updated anymore, and newer mods have cool systems I'd like to use (plus, this pack is complete - so all I've been doing for the past few updates is bugfixes and minor tweaks).

I'll also tweak the server pack as needed, just let me know what needs to be changed.

Since the issue tracker is just the GitHub repository, I'll leave the label for this pack up - just in case people report more minor bugs that others may want to know about.

Thank you for downloading & playing this pack, and I hope you enjoy my newer ones as much as you enjoyed this.


Added a processing tree to convert liquid XP (and its variants) into Liquified Research
- It now has to be fractionated into Fluidic Theorems, which have a chance to give a Knowledge Data Unit (which can also be crafted)
- After that, it must be fluid transposed into an Empty Knowledge Data Unit to create a Knowledge Data Unit, which can then be melted into more Liquified Research
- Due to this new tree, processing XP now uses slightly less fluid, and gives more research
The "Dust Collection" reward table now gives TE sulfur
- Added more dusts
