v2.0 Changelog

Changed sell values of a few Composite-tier ingots
- Also Platinum & Titanium Ingots, and Enriched Uranium (Highly Advanced)
-- Altered coin values for all changed metals (coins always sell for ~25% more than their ingot counterpart)

Halved value of shiny golden apples (from $5k to $2.5k)
Added value tooltips for all items that can be sold
- Ones that can be bought will come later

Added decrafting recipes for Just Coins' items

Actually remove Capacity Upgrade x64 recipe to replace it with my own
Added intended Item Stage support for a few Extended Crafting blocks
- Currently the Tier 3 & 4 Table, and the Quantum Compressor. I doubt more will come.

Updated quest dependencies of a few things
Fixed a few other minor bugs
- Note that there's currently a weird quest duplication bug happening. No clue why but it isn't breaking things, just being annoying.

You can now sell some fluids:
Note: Prices are for every 1,000 Millibuckets (mB) [Equal to 1 bucket]
(Filled buckets of each fluid also have tooltips reflecting their values)

Diamond Miner is now cheaper (4 total diamonds instead of the default 10)
- Fixed recipe for Diamond Upgrade needing a Diamond Upgrade

Re-added Burn Time to Fuel Pellets
- No idea why or how it got removed

Changed rewards on "Basic Ore Doubling"
Changed the way "Researching Hell" works to match the way it works for the Overworld research (where you submit X amount of anything in the category)
- "Researching Hell II" remains the same since I can't settle on a specific amount of items to find
-- I planned to change "The End", but since everything is much more spread out in that dimension I'll have to add multiple game stages

Restructured all of "Cheques & Balances", every quest is now combined into 1; with 3 extras you can do afterwards as an optional challenge
- Also renamed it to "The Money Factory"
-- Also added several secret optional challenges, and made the quest shapes consistent with my system

Changed/added sell values for a few items
Fixed some broken scripts
Added a few new alternate recipes for items

Added Exchangers
Added Food Expansion
Added Mo' Villages
-  This is one of my standard mods and idk why i didnt have it. Would be nice if I could reduce the spawnrates though.
Added Better Than Mending
Added EnderStorage
- Has its own Game Stage that must be researched

Added AE2 Stuff
- Disabled Pattern Encoder
Added Energy Converters
- Remember that MJ producers need a wooden kinesis pipe
Added Ranged Pumps
Added Long Fall Boots
- Reduced durability from 858 to 750
-- Might change again later, but it doesn't use durability to prevent fall damage and is somewhat cheap to craft
Added Flux Networks
