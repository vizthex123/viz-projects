v10.0 Changelog (Finality):


The final (major) content update!

This will add the last few pending late-game quests I wanted to add, some balancing changes, etc.

I wanted to add Advanced Rocketry quests too, but the mod is dumb & doesn't work so I won't do that.


Added a new fluid: Alien Goo
- You gain it by melting down Tech Guns' Alien Blaster in a Magma Crucible (makes 10,000 mB of fluid per item) and processing Alien Bugs in an Enstabulation Apparatus (makes 2,500 mB per mob)
- Currently, its only use is to be processed into Liquified Research (in a Fractionating Still. 500 mB makes 250 mB of research)
Re-enabled the Centrifugal Separator and its augment: Enstabulation Apparatus
- Added recipes to process Alien Bugs, Nether Wasps, and Cyberdemons
Overhauled the recipes for storage cells
Changed the base RF storage of all Thermal Innovation items to 25,000
- This value will scale with the item tier, so by the time you get resonant it should be at ~100k or more
