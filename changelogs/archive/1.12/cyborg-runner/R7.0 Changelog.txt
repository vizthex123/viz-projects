v7.0 Changelog:

So I know I said that v6.2 would be the final update.... but I then I started playing again and found more stuff I could fix.

So, you now have v7.0! (and v6.3, which I released awhile ago)

This'll probably happen for my other 1.12 packs if I ever re-play them.

I do still consider the pack complete, but I tend to just keep adding stuff until I eventually stop playing (which you can easily see in Capitalia).


Template Changes:

The template world is now locked to hard mode, due to my original scaling plan not working properly. If you wish to reduce it using NBT editing or commands or what have you, feel free to do so.
Added the missing survivor diaries
Fixed the various written books saying they were written by vizthex instead of unknown authors
Fixed up the roads so the village looks more like a constructed village rather than a worldgen one
Removed the linking book from the starting area
Tweaked the rewards of a few secrets
Tweaked the starting village a bit:
- Slightly reduced the number of spawners, removed the Furnace Generator (that wasn't supposed to be there)
- Increased the range of the turrets to 10 and doubled their starting ammo
- Added some more secrets
- Removed the difficulty lock, should fix how it's meant to increase over time
- I was also going to disable cheats, but that breaks a lot of the technical quests; so they must remain




Quest Changes:

Fixed the Security Log quest not accepting the Security Log
Changed the reward for Specialized Crafting
Changed the feather reward in "Running" to an Ink Vial
Quests now unlock based on progression (like Capitalia's quests), that way you don't get overwhelmed & have a clear goal from the start.




Research Changes:

Added hints for all the Artisan's Tables and cooking researches
Renamed furnace researches to "Smelting" (was "Cooking")
Re-organized the "Crafting" research tree to prevent visual weirdness with the dependency lines
Added more accepted items to several researches
- It's mainly in the constants file (which are basically categories that multiple researches use), but I did greatly expanded the list of accepted items for the Engineering & Science researches

Changed the Solderer in the Designer's Workshop recipe to Cutters

The Ore Processing upgrade now requires Steel instead of Lead
Added the Carpenter's Worktable and Artisan's Handsaw, alongside recipes that use them both
- It must be researched after unlocking the Basic Worktable in order to be used
- You can use the saws to gain some extra wood from logs, and have a chance to get Sawdust
- Sawdust can be compressed then smelted into Charcoal, or used to make an MDF Board (which acts like wooden planks)
- A few table recipes now use the Handsaw, listed below
