v3.1 Changelog


Fixed Giant & Maximum Compact Machines not showing up in JEI
The HUDLens & HUDJack overlays now "float" as you move
- HUDJacks have almost no "float"
Re-enabled Thermal Foundation's Hammers & Excavators
- I didn't intend for them to be disabled at all, but oh well
Fixed the technology research not granting it to you
- If you researched it but didn't receive the stage, do /gamestage add @p technology
The Mason's worktable/station/shop now function as normal crafting tables
Buffed the recipes for Cheese
- The Fire Charge one now gives 3, Lava gives 5


More entities can spawn with Cyberware augments
Added a tooltip to the Katana about its function, and increase its attack damage to 15
Cyberskeletons are a tad more common now, and can spawn in bigger groups
Fixed the recipe conflict with top & bottom buns
Increased the chance of getting a blueprint from a salvaged item back to the 15% default
Tweaked durability costs of a few XL Food recipes
Added loot to the last few vanilla enemies that were missing it
Disabled the Last Stand enchantment
- XP is much more valuable since you need to level up your skills to progress, so wasting it on taking another hit or two is a bit annoying.
-- Note that it may still appear on dropped gear, so if you really want to use it; you can. (or even dischant the item and put it on something better)



Added Compacter
- Renamed it to "Compactor", made it early-game, added a quest


Removed BetterBedrockGen
- COFH Core does the same thing, but better
