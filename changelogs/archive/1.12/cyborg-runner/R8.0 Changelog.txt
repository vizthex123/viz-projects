v8.0 Changelog:

I'm basically requiring you to make a new world as I've changed a lot of internal stuff which will break existing ones (especially if you're still in the Alien Jungle).


Well, I'm back for another legacy pack update. This one is gonna replace PackedUp and Refined Storage, so please retrieve your items before updating (though I recommend restarting due to many worldgen, progression, mod, and quest changes).

In addition, I added several more performance mods to help curb the lag (though I'm sure it can still happen rarely).

Also reduced the confusion research has caused some people by adding more hints, as suggested by Gold on the Discord. Also added Scannable at his suggestion.

BE SURE TO MAKE A NEW WORLD!



Main changes

Fixed the ending so it actually works as intended
- I started a few variations of it and never got around to fully finishing it until now lol. Sorry about that!
Tweaked the "A Defensible Platform" quest to better reflect the actual set-up

Added multiple optimization mods, (probably) making this my most-optimized modpack
- If anyone is playing on a low-end PC, please let me know how much of a difference this makes compared to v7.0. I managed to get a (mostly) stable 144 FPS with max settings vs. ~60 with great TPS lag in v7.0.

Added quests for each tier of gear so players can follow the intended progression (if they want to)
Tweaked the default options:
- Excavate is now bound to nothing
- Quests is now bound to grave (~ next to 1 on the number row)
- Cyberware menu is now bound to Z


The maximum Cyberware Tolerance has been increased to 150 (was 125)
- Cyberware Rejection now begins at 15 Tolerance (10% of the maximum. Was 20).


Reduced maximum health to 60
Players now lose some HP-XP on death
Scaling Health's heart containers can no longer be used to increase your maximum health
- However, they can still be used for healing and crafting
The default difficulty is now set to "Normal"
- You can still change it with Sol Credits, but as with the rest of the black market it requires the "Communication" quest to be completed


All large ore deposits no longer generate in the Alien Jungle
Most ores no longer generate in the Alien Jungle
- Crimson Coal, Iron, Tin, Electrotine, Moon Stone, Salt, and Drained/Tier 1 XP Ores are the only ones that remain


Replaced all Coins in various secrets & quests with Credit Chips (with 5 values instead of the 4 coins had)
- Tweaked the contents of a couple secrets, replacing Coins with Credit Chips and slightly altering the main reward
- Sol Credit Chips act as a collectible that can be exchanged for some unique items, or converted into Credit Chips after the appropriate research is discovered


Finally managed to add in some custom Alchemistry recipes
- You can now dissolve Barely, Flour, and various items from the Glacidus and Vulcanite mods
- Added a chemical combiner recipe for Wheat
Replaced JJCoin with a series of custom Credit Chip items
Finally fixed the annoying bug that made worlds default to Peaceful when they should be on Normal
Greatly expanded the list of accepted items across all the research
- This fixes several researches not accepting the full list of items they should (e.g. anything that accepts redstone not accepting the full list of redstone items)
-- I also went through and manually checked all of them, fixing the ones that needed it and tweaking things to fit the new recipes & progression
- As always, please let me know if you feel like a specific research should accept more item(s)
- (The categories file went from 806 lines to 2,379 lol)


Added several new items
- Added Slime Dyes for all colours (Rosin and Tar make artificial dye)
- The Molecular Rearranger replaces coins in all conversion recipes
- Credit Chips replace Coins, and JJCoin will be removed due to this. The 50 and 100 Chips can be turned into RF Numismatic Dynamo. 
-- Due to this, the Toilary Mold and all associated recipes have been removed
- Pulsaton can be found in the eponymous ore, and the ore can also drop Pure Coal. I can't get the droprates I want working though, so for now it's got a rare chance to drop Pure Coal instead of Pulsaton. Pulsaton Slivers can be used for various electronics, or turned into 50,000 RF in a Numismatic Dynamo with Lapidary Calibration





Replaced all nutrients with 3 new ones:
- Calories
- Energy
- Vitamins & Minerals (both share the same bar)

Calories functions almost identically to vanilla hunger: Every food has it, and if enough is lost then you'll get negative effects
Energy is similar to the energy system Cyberware uses - it's like calories for the player's cybernetics. Fewer items have it, but it drains slower and has a lower threshold for negative effects
Vitamines & Minerals work in conjuction with calories to give both beneficial and negative effects at certain thresholds
Nutrition loss on death has been restored. Players now lose 5% nutrients per death, and the bars can go down to 0
- Due to this, you will have multiple negative effects if you die a lot - but I did try to make them more of a nusiance than an actual downside (alongside some difficulty tweaks)
- To help offset this negative feedback loop, more quests give food rewards now

I may revise, revert, or remove this system later on - but for now I think it's a good replacement. At any given time, you couldn't really refill the Dairy and Grains (and Sugars, to a lesser extent) ones due to the lack of items in the Alien Jungle, and with progress to other dimensions taking a bit of time it ended up being an annoying nusiance rather than a somewhat decent way to incentivise players to craft various types of food rather than farming a single one forever.

Moved all Artisan Tool unlocks to a new research
- The only exception to this are the Hammers and Cutters, which still unlock with the Basic Worktable research (with said research now being named "Specialized Crafting")
All Artisan's Worktable recipes now have the proper locks in place
- This prevents you from looking up all of them in JEI, as the point is to discover things as you go along

- Will probably make the game load a tad faster, but it's mostly a backend change
Finally migrated my ContentTweaker items to use lang files instead of scripts
- This means that you can now translate the item names into any language (that Minecraft 1.12.2 supports), and I can said translations to the pack. If you wish to do so, let me know on the Discord or in the comments. I'll help you put it into the correct format if needed.

Changed the starting Left Cyberarm to a Right Cyberarm
The Compact Machines dimension will always be chunkloaded
Assigned scanning colours, rarities, and OreDict entries to all the ores in the modpack

Residuum and Opesium can now be turned into RF
Replaced the RPG-HUD info quest with one about Emergency Items

Players now get a hint about capsule crafting recipes after obtaining a base or capsule
Changed the internal name for DIY Melon Circuits
- This will erase any existing ones in the world, so if you are playing an old world you should've made a new one. But if you insist, be sure to either write down and cheat in or re-craft the ones you already had.


Integrated Glacidus' content much better (recipes, powergen, research, etc.)
Added OreDict entries to the ores that were missing them
- This allows Scannable to find said ores, and the player to view them all by typing $ore into JEI
