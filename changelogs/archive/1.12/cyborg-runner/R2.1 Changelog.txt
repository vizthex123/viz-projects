v2.1 Changelog


Dropped the "revival" tag since the project has been revived
2 new sprites made by masterfulpotato#4037 on the Discord
Fixed multiple researches not having the correct requirements


Enabled Nutrition loss on death (all bars get reduced by 25%)
Reduced nutrition multiplier to 3x the default
Fixed broken name of "Vegetables" nutrition
Increased global decay rate to 1.5x the default
- Protein still decays at 1x the rate though (because protein is a high-energy, low-absorption rate nutrient IRL)
Increased nutrition loss to 10%
- This is to prevent more complex foods from filling most of the bar, which kind of ruins the point of the mod


Fixed the Ice Cream Sandwich recipes not registering properly, removed water cost. They now require Ice as a secondary input. (Gelid Cryotheum one remains unchanged  though)
Several vanilla foods now need the Chef's Table
Added a Stone Hammer and Cutter as rewards for making a Basic Worktable
Changed recipe for Cheese, added an extra one
Chocolate Syrup is now behind the "cooking" stage
Staged Oreo Cookies behind "cooking"


Changed the recipe for waffles
Fixed the Pumpkin Mash recipe using a bowl as a secondary ingredient instead of a main one
Removed the secondary recipe for Pumpkin Bread
Buffed the hunger & saturation values for Pumpkin Stew and Bacon Pie
Should've fixed the Satchel not lacking staging
Rebalanced Bone and Gold sword damages


Skeletons now have a half second cooldown between shots
Fixed the Nutrition button overlapping with the offhand slot (at least on "Auto" GUI scaling)
Updated a few quest rewards that didn't auto-claim, even though they were supposed too
XL Food's cans are now unlocked with the "Cooking" research
- "Beverages" now only needs "Basic Cooking"
Fixed a recipe conflict with Stone Crafting Plates and Cobblestone Parts
