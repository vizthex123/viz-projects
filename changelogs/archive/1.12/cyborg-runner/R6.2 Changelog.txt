v6.2 Changelog:


Alright, I'm declaring this and all of my other 1.12 modpacks unsupported. I will fix any game-breaking issues, crashes, etc. if people report them - but I'm finally moving out of my rut and onto 1.16+. Mods for 1.12 aren't really being updated anymore, and newer mods have cool systems I'd like to use (plus, this pack is complete - so all I've been doing for the past few updates is bugfixes and minor tweaks).

Since the issue tracker is just the GitHub repository, I'll leave the label for this pack up - just in case people report more minor bugs that others may want to know about.

Thank you for downloading & playing this pack, and I hope you enjoy my newer ones as much as you enjoyed this.



Finally configured Scaling Wealth
- Every vanilla enemy now has a chance to drop coins based on the current difficulty (the Scaling Health difficulty, not the game difficulty)
- Most modded mobs will too, but I couldn't get BetterSlimes' to work.
- Adjusted some existing droprates
Fixed Ceramics recycling recipes giving clay blocks instead of balls
Added a couple more quests
