v6.0 Changelog:


IMPORTANT: Open Terrain Generator may be asking for OTG Core v9.4, simply delete the ones from mods/1.12.2 and it will fix itself when you load the game again!

Added an ending
- It's vastly different from what I wanted, but it works for now. I can't get Onslaught to work the way I want it to, but I've delayed the ending for too long already.

If anyone knows how to make the mod work, please let me know and you can help me make a proper ending.
