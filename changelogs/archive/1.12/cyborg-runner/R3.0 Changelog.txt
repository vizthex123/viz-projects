v3.0 Changelog


Added a recipe to swap between mushroom types
Fixed multiple broken recipes
Fixed how the Basic Worktable didn't work as a normal crafting table
Should've fixed the building skill tree not giving you the points needed to unlock Perfect Recover
Reduced the amount of negative effects Mystcraft instability can cause
Updated damaged Solarskin sprite (thanks to @masterfulpotato#4037 on the Discord for doing it)
Slightly moved the position of the Nutrient button (gives a bit of buffer space in-between it and the offhand slot)
The Toilary Mold can now be used in a Blacksmith's Workstation (or shop) to make Toilaries out of ingots
Changed several Miniaturization recipes
Increased maximum Tolerance to 125, rejection now starts at 20


Overhauled the entire tool/armour progression, using Reskillable. Changed some stats too. (e.g. diamond tools now have 1,250 Durability instead of 1,561)
For the new progression list, go to #modpack-updates on the Discord
Boosted the durability of Golden tools (Artisan's included) to 75

Set the global nutrition decay rate to 0.85x
- This is because I noticed that you use the nutrients quite fast, and crafting food is somewhat if you got a bad Mystcraft roll (like I did). Lore-wise, this is because cybernetics enhance the digestive system. (I don't plan to change the value again, hopefully I won't have to)
Added a new nutrient: Sugars
- It drains fast, but isn't all that hard to gain. There's 45 foods that I've added to the list, most of which are the "dessert" items from XL Food.
The starting nutrients have been boosted to 35% so you don't immediately start with the worst effects
Overeating has been enabled. This allows you to eat food even if your hunger bar is full, which allows you to absorb the nutrients from them
- If I find it to be unbalanced though, I'll change it back
Tweaked the thresholds for the default potion effects
- I was originally going to add multiple stages of various effects, but during my own testing I've found that it's quite hard to get good food items, so you'd basically always have negative effects.


Heart Containers no longer consume XP on use
- I meant to enable this in v2.1, but forgot
Reduced the crafting time of the Miner's Ring to 3 seconds (was 10)
(Vanilla) Buckets can now be smelted into 3 Iron Ingots
Fixed how the Toolbox didn't use the Ore Dictionary
Re-enabled Bone and Flint artisan's tools
Changed Compact Machines (the block) recipes to use various circuits


Dried Flesh is no longer gated behind the "cooking" stage
Vanilla soups/stews are now staged behind "cooking" instead of "advanced cooking"
- In addition, Carrot Soup has also been changed to "cooking"
Natura's Berry Medley is no longer behind the "advanced cooking" stage
Vanilla Cream & Tomato Sauce are no longer staged behind "advanced cooking"
Dough & various "snack items" are now part of the Cooking stage
Blights now properly reduce difficulty, and are a bit more common
Tweaked Nutrient drain rates
Improved output of all Open Modular Turrets ammo recipes
Increased rewards on all Artisan's Table quests
Prismarine blocks can now be turned into Shards/Crystals in a Mason's Worktable/station
Changed all soups/stews to not use Bowls as a secondary ingredient
- This allows you to craft them in the Chef's Worktable instead of needing at least a Station
Removed the duplicate Tropical Fish Soup recipe







Added SignEdit
Added Double Doors
Added Fortune Gives Experience
- This should stack with COFH's "Insight" enchantment
Added XP From Harvest
Added XP Ore
Added CleanView
Added Too Many Efficiency Losses
Added Anvil Patch - lawful


Removed Cooking for Blockheads
- Since I migrated food recipes to Artisan's Worktables, this mod no longer functions for 90% of the recipes. The quests have been removed as well, and replaced with ones to make each Artisan's Table
Actually removed the following mods:
- Ore Stages
- Extended Crafting
- FactInventory
- Demagnetize
- Roguelike Dungeons
- Torch Bandolier
- Simple Quarry
- Chest Hoppers
