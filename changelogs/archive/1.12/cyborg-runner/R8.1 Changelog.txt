v8.1 Changelog:

Main changes

Added a menu for 1080p
- My monitor is 1440p, so I just kinda forgot to do this lol


Updated both books you find in the starting crashed ship
Added a Credit Chip to the ship so players can unlock the Alien Jungle portal without exploring
The regular attack waves now have better enemies
- Replaced Elder Guardians with cyber mobs
Overhauled regular attack waves
- The first few now trigger later so you have time to gather basic materials & whatnot


Added an arrow pointing to the research quests
Moved most quests downwards in Chapter 1 to help mitigate UI clutter
Removed the rotten flesh from player's starting inventory
Fixed the worldborder not being set properly
Tweaked the droprates for Credit Chips


Disabled Project Red's oregen
- Everything still generates with CoFH Core so I can properly control it
Restored the old method of warning people not to use OTG
The Research Table is now made in a Mason's Worktable
Tweaked XP rewards on info quests to better reflect the amount of reading each one requires
- All of them no longer trigger the "reward claimed!" toast




Bugfixes

Fixed the Gold Capsule not being craftable
Fixed (non-Electrotine) Project Red ores spawning in the Alien Jungle
Fixed Coal spawning in the Alien Jungle when it should be spawning Crimson Coal instead
Fixed the Artisanal Tools research not accepting as many items as it should
- Reduced it to 2 items instead of 3
- Moved its position in the UI to make things clearer





Balance changes

Tweaked HP-XP scaling
- Players now require about double the kills per level
- Players no longer lose HP-XP on death


Halved the nutrition foods restore
Players now lose 15% nutrients on death (was 10)
- Sadly, I can't configure it per-nutrient like I want to, so I might change this again in a future update.
Tweaked rally health a bit
- You now have a 5 second window (was 3)
- Chance to regain health is now 90% (was 80)
- Now plays a sound if you successfully heal


Tweaked Electrotine generation
- Now spawns at Y=0 to 32 (was 1 to 24)




Economy changes

Removed the robosurgeon selling quest
- Players can now craft Robosurgeons and Surgery Chambers in a Basic Worktable in case they lose the starting ones (or forget to grab them)
- Spare Robosurgeons you may find can be decrafted into the parts you use to craft them







Quest changes

Reward tables in Chapter 3 are now random instead of choices





Recipe changes

Basic Circuits now accept Redstone and Electrotine (was Electrotine only)
The Miner's Ring is now made in a Basic Worktable
- Now requires Redstone or Electrotine instead of an Electrotine Alloy Ingot






Research changes

Research Hints are now much more useful
- Each one now requires items equal to what the research itself accepts (e.g. if the research needs 3 items then the hint needs 3 items)
- Updated descriptions so they're actually useful now
Most researches can now utilize the Magifying Glass
- Due to the way it works, I can only add 1 scannable block per category in the match game, so you will still have to scan somewhat random blocks (although several can be deduced from reading the text and quest hints).


Moved some of the "Crafting" research around to make it a bit more sensible
"Sol Credit Conversion" now requires the Basic Worktable research 
The Recycling research now requires the Basic Worktable research
- Now requires 2 items instead of 3
- Move its position in the research UI so players can more easily notice the dependency requirement




Misc changes

De-staged Thermal Foundation
Wooden Mortars no longer have a skill lock
Added names to most of my custom recipes
- Has basically 0 impact on the end user, but it lets me pad out the changelog so I'm listing it anyway
