v5.0 Changelog


Replaced Research Table with From the Ground Up
- Migrated all current research to FTGU. It still uses Game Stages, so you shouldn't lose any progress. If you did though, just say so on the Discord and I'll give you steps to fix it.
- You will have to re-do your research though. "Special Cooking" is currently the only research that doesn't use Game Stages.


Added Electrotine & its block to the Enervation Dynamo
Changed the texture for Slime Green Dye
Fixed Bonecraft armour not having the correct durability
Increased the burn time of Book & Quill to 125 (was 50)
Added pulverizer versions of the various decraft recipes done in a Mason's Worktable
Increased durability of Golden items to 100 (+30 on armour pieces)
Changed durability of stone Artisan's Tools to 125
Pumpkin Stew has been moved to the "cooking" stage
Added XL Food's crops to the Simple Harvest config
- This lets you right-click harvest them, like with vanilla crops.
Changed the colour of the Chemist's Worktable UI
- It's a bit lighter now, so it should be easier to see things. This change isn't reflected in JEI though.
Added 5 durability to each piece of Clay Armour
Reduced Clay Shears durability to 75


Removed the "Special Foods" stage, since From the Ground Up can just lock specific items
Removed the "Beverages" (drinks) stage, since From the Ground Up can just lock specific items
Nerfed Fuel Canister storage to 512 (was 4,096)
- Updated its tooltips to show fuel gain from accepted items
- Added Nibrock's Coals to the accepted items list
- Added Crimson Coal (and its blocks) to accepted items list
Fixed Turret Base T1 not using the Ore Dictionary
Crimson Coal can rarely drop from Coal Ore
Added Crimson and Nibrock's coal to the Dense and Super coal ores
- Both have higher droprates for the better types of coal
Chaotic Coal Ore can also drop the rare types of coal, and in higher quantities


Updated Large Ore Deposits worldgen, it should now include dense and super version of all ores
- Coal deposits can also spawn Crimson Coal's ores
Added Leather Armour to the "Basic Defenses" quest
Added Heart Crystals to the Enervation Dynamo
Melon Slices and Carrots now have the sugar nutrient
Ceramics items can now be recycled into Clay when pulverized
- Gives back half of the Clay used to make the item
- Recipes only added for fired clay items, since the mod does unfired on its own
- All of them use 1,000 RF, except for the Clay Plate which uses 500
Re-added Unfired Clay Shears


Slightly increased skeleton arrow shot cooldown (changed from 10 ticks to 25)
The Blacksmith's Workstation (T2) now requires Stone Bricks
Added skill locks to Project: Red tools & armour
Migrated the Artisan's Worktables script to its own folder
- 100% a back-end change, but it makes them more readable and easier to make recipes for




Replaced Block Drops Tweaker with Dropt
- This is 99% (I think it works slightly better than the Block Drops Tweaker mod I was using) a back-end change, so you won't really see any difference. But it makes things easier to change for me.
