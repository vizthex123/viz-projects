The new world template has been added to the game. I meant to do this in v5.0, but forgot. Sorry. It's got a few secrets and lore bits, if you're interested.


Finished migrating research over to From the Ground Up
- Storage Compression (Refined Storage) and Advanced Mining (Ore Excavation) have been migrated
Tweaked XP requirements for Level Up HP
- Now increases by 15 per level, base requirement is 35
Added a few more items as acceptable for the Thermal Technology research's idea
Slimes can no longer spawn as Champions
Increased damaged done by Flint & Steel to 10
Fixed how the basic cooking research gave the wrong game stage
Fixed Bows not having the proper stat requirements


Reduce the mining level of the Bone Pickaxe to 1 (same as stone)
Fixed a few broken scripts
Tweaked droprates of Nibrock's Coal from Coal, Chaotic, and Crimson ores
Increased the amount of time the player has to respond to the first IPC attack, tweaked the others
Added a third IPC attack wave
- More are planned (which you can see on the Trello board here:Â https://trello.com/c/IxUrlP7C/352-ipc-attacks), but for now just the 3 are in the game.
