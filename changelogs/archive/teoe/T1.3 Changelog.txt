v1.3 - More Quests Update

Changed description of "Craft-a-star"
-Added rewards....sorry I forgot about those...
Finally added more quests to the Thaumcraft questgroup
-Changed a couple descriptions & rewards
--Re-organized the quests to make them make more sense

Added 10 New Quests total


Sorry for the small patch again, I'm still stumped as to what quests to add..... other than Thaumcraft (which I'm still wondering how to properly structure).
