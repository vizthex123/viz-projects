Mod Edits


Added Alternate Terrain Generation by TTFCUTS
Added Keeping Inventory by Silly511
Added The Twilight Forest by Benimatic


Edited config for Iguana's Tinker Tweaks, making vanilla tools unusable
Edited Morph config, so now you can't fly with it (This is to encourage use of alt flight options)
Edited Tinker's Construct config to make the Smeltery only give 1 Ingot per ore (This is to discourage using it as ore doubling)


Removed Super Ores, spawn rates are WAY too high & there's no config so I can't change that...
-To compensate, upped the spawn rates for all Dense Ores


Disabled Blood Moons
