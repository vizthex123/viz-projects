v2.3.1 Changelog - Hotfixs And Rewards

Mod Changes

Replaced MineTweaker with CraftTweaker (by jaredIII08 and lanse505)
- It works like MineTweaker and will hopefully fix the chat console spamming "COULD NOT RESOLVE <null>" every time you load a world)
-- It also makes ModTweaker work a bit better
Added all Project Red modules (I can't believe I forgot to do this before publishing v1.0 LOL)
Added Forge Multipart by chicken_bones
-Added FMPI by wasilebob



Quest Changes

Fixed how I broke the quest order in Botania...sorry about that...
-Did this by completely re-doing the structure
Fixed "Unlocking: A Quest" description
Changed "Unlocking" Applied Energistics" description
Changed unlock requirements for "Unlocking: Draconic Evolution"
Changed description for "Ewy's Upgrade"
-Changed rewards
--Fixed typos
Changed description for "The Nether"
Changed rewards for "Unlocking: Logistics Pipes"
Changed "Lucky Things" rewards & requirements
Changed "Stuff For Magic" requirements & rewards
Changed ALL AE Cell quests to "Detection" (Crafting wouldn't pick them up)



Recipe Changes

Added recipe for Chance Icosahedron
-Changed EMC to reflect recipe cost
Added recipe for turning Bedrock into Randomite Ore (The stone type)
-This is due to my Testers getting lots of the "Trollin'" reward but not being able to use the Bedrock
Changed recipe for Material Cache
Added recipe for each LootRoulette material (Using Botania' Runic Altar)
Added recipe for Basic reward bag (Using Runic Altar) [Please tell me if this is balanced, cuz idk if it is...]
Removed HQM bag recipes using LootRoulette
Changed recipe for Record Fragment



Misc

Changed EMC of Transmutation Tablet (It had an EMC that was too low...xD)
Removed EMC of Asgardilak...that OP flower from Avaritia that gives infinite Mana, it's got 0 EMC now
-This is because the "Trollin'" reward gives Bedrock, and since you can't do anything with it...
--Also 2 new rewards give Bedrock
Added new Reward Bag loot (A few of them were added to "The Best RNG" group)
Tweaked a few Reward Bag groups (Mostly changing amount of times you can get an item)
Removed Golden Eye 64 reward
-Due to the Eyes being useless and you getting it a lot. Plus you can craft it if you really want them

Added 7 new quests total (I'm still learning how to use Draconic Evolution so those won't be added until later!)
