v2.4 - Quests, Fixes & Mods


Mod Changes


Added Simply Currency by momnop
-Added recipes for each Coin
--This is mainly to server-proof the pack but also helps with balancing recipes
Changed recipe of Nether Star (Craftable Nether Star + version)
Fixed last 2 Klein Star quests
Changed all "Transmutation!" rewards to Chance Icosahedron + Reward Bag (Rarity varies)

Recipe Changes


Removed recipe for Basic Reward Bag
-Added new recipes for every HQM Bag
Removed shapeless recipe for Blaze Powder (Only the 1 Redstone and 1 Glowstone recipe, vanilla one is fine)
Same with shaped (1 Stick, 4 Blaze Powder)
-This is due to being able to hack both recipes and exploit the way they're designed to be able to get Blaze Rods/Powder earlier than intended
Changed LootRoulette's Material Cache to require Coins (Again, balance)
Changed all Grindstone recipes I added to 1 turn
Changed Record Fragment recipe's input to Diamond Lattice
Changed HQM Heart recipes to Shapeless (Finally!)
Changed Craftable Nether Star + recipe to default recipe
Added coins to each recipe for Loot Roulette materials
Added Unstable Ingot Block to recipe for Tome of Knowledge (Still can't make it shapeless, sorry)
Added Platinum Coin to recipe for Tome of Knowledge
Changed recipe for all Loot Bags to need Coins as well (For balancing) [Coin(s) corrospondes w/ bag tier]
-Removed all shapless recipes for every Loot Bag
Added recipe to turn Full Hearts into Minature Red Hearts and/or Coins (2 Seperate recipes but the Player can use whichever they want)
-The Coin one is kinda like "Selling" it, and the Red Heart is to (sorta) give it an EMC and give you a way to use any extra Full Hearts laying around
Removed Extra Utilities Nether Star recipe
-Added different recipe
Fixed typos


Misc


Changed several reward bag rewards (Both reward and times you can get)
-Added new ones
--Changed the rarity of "RNG Smiles Upon You" rewards
