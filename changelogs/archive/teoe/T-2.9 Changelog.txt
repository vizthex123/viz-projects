v2.9 Changelog - 300 Quests!

Quest Edits:


Added 9 Reputations:


Thaumaturgical Council (Thaumcraft),
Magic Counsel (All 3 magic mods),
Druid Society (Botania),
Vampirical Gathering (Blood Magic),
Technological Innovators (All Tech mods),
Alchemical Circle (ProjectE/ExtraE),
Scientific Bureau (Anything related to tech, science, rocketry, etc..) [Actually kinda the same as Technological Innovators, but needs more reputation and will have better quests. But the Technological Innovators is also more of a first-time discovery thing, like real innovation; so I think that kinda balances it out],
Chemistrial Atomium (MineChem),
Blacksmith's Associates (Tinker's, maybe a couple other things...).



Each reputation will eventually™ have certian quests connected to them, as well as some cool items (perhaps)
In addition, some mods may contribute to multiple reputations, for example:
Electro-Magic Tools is part of the Thaumaturgical Council, Technological Innovators, and Magic Counsel because it covers those 3 themes. A few other mods may be like this, but you'll have to play to find out.
