Changed "Start on Gooder Tools" requirements
Changed unlock requirements for "Hidden Expensive Items"
Changed unlock requirements for "More...Storage...." from only Infinity Ingots to Ingots + Compressed Chest
(Lazily) finished the quests for Ewy's Workshop, by adding a quest for all the upgrades.
-One of them has its own quest though, since it needs Nether materials
--It basically counts as [REDACTED] quests...
I'm pausing work on the Botania questgroup for now, til I can figure out more quests to add.......so no quests for that for a bit
-Fixed many missing things from Botania questgroup...sorry for breaking it...
Blood Magic quests are completed, though they have been since v1.0.......(Fixed descriptions though)
Fixed "The Nether" because...I broke the quest...
Changed "Transmitting the Water" to "Moving The Water"
Changed reference "Stuff For Tech" makes
-Also fixed my typos
Changed reference of "Power Transmission" (All but IE)
Changed rewards of "Power Transmission" (TE)
-Changed quest type from "Crafting" to"Detection"
Changed order of several IE quests
Changed unlock requirements for [DATA EXPUNGED] in "Technology"
Busy working on trying to structure the Thaumcraft/AE Quests, so there might not be a patch for awhile, but I haven't abonded the development.

 

Removed Equivalent Energistics cuz it caused too many crashes (as in, place the blocks it has to use to function = crash, which is bad...)

 

Added 3 new quests total (Unless you count the new Ewy's upgrades quests as [REDACTED] quests...)
