v1.8 Changelog - Basically More Bugfixes

Changed rewards the reward bags give (I accidentally made them very OP...)
Added new quest for getting 1,000 Dense Energy Cells (MUHAHAHAHHAHA >:D)
Changed EMC's of processors from AE, so they have the correct amount (Instead of 4,096 per)
Fixed ME IO Port quest (Added something to do for it and named it...xD)
Started Logistics Pipes questline
-Made the Buildcraft one visible
Fixed "Compressed Storage" (Crazy Stuff) (Gave Giant Chance Cube instead of Normal)
Fixed "Thaumcraft" (I forgot to add a Crucible to the Crucible part xD)
Fixed "Pure Daisy" (Made it detection, as HQM doesn't pick up the crafting)
Added custom achievement icons for:
ExtraE



Mod Edits:

Added LootBags by Malorolam
-Changed chest drop rates to make them rare (Can't do that with the regular drop rates though, so if they are too common I'll remove the mod)
Added Hardcore Wither by thor12022
Changed config for Modular Powersuits, RF gives 1 Power per and EU gives 0.5 Power per (Though IC2 isn't installed)
-Also, when you change a module mode it will say so in chat
--Disabled Clock, Compass, Lux Capacitor, Binoculars and Magnet modules
---Enabled EnderIO recipes
Changed Craftable Nether Star + config, Nether Star now needs nether materials to craft
Updated Storage Drawers
Edited Config of Igauana's Tinker Tweaks, so you can use vanilla tools now (This was supposed to be in the last patch, but I forgot...)
-Not bows though, as they are bad + Tinker's ones are way better

If I can ever learn how to use it I'll add MineTweaker (so I can configure some recipes).
