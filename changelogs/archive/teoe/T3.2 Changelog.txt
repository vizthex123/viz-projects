v3.2 Changelog - Quest improvements


NOTE: If you find any quests that give Invalid Item as a reward, please report it on the issue tracker with the name of the quest and the branch it's in (example: "The Basics", "Unlocking: A Quest")

 

Fixed issue #3
- Because I can't disable The One Ring, it's just hidden form NEI and I've added a warning tooltip (as well as a recipe to change it into 2 Legendary Reward Bags (subject to change))
Changed requirment for "Unlocking: A Quest" to require 1 Mystical Topaz
Updated and added some quests to "Reputations"
Updated rewards for Blood Magic altar quests
