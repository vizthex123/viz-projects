Well, I've said before that I'd abandoned this modpack - and although that's true, I did want to update it one final time due to [the sequel](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2) being released (and I'm so on-time for that!) in addition to the 8-year anniversary (which I couldn't meet since CurseForge had to reject the update twice).

A couple mods have been deleted off of CurseForge, so I've removed or replaced them (full list at the bottom, as usual).

I recommend making a new world if you're not too far into the pack due to the overhauled quests and sizeable changes to the modlist.

Anyway, onto the changes & fixes.


# Main changes

Fixed issues [#4](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe/issues/4), [#5](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe/issues/5), [#6](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe/issues/6), [#7](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe/issues/7), and [#8](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe/issues/8).
Finally managed to make the Tome of Knowledge recipe shapeless (as it was always meant to be).
- Also moved it to the Huge Crafting Table
Had to remove[AOBD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/another-one-bites-the-dust) to publish this update. Hope it gets put back on CF soon.


Added a proper logo to the quest book
Rebalanced the rewards for basically every quest
Changed most Submission tasks to Detection tasks
- This means you no longer have to effectively trash a bunch of useful items to finish one quest
Changed all Crafting tasks to Detection tasks
- This lets you easily complete quests if you did something out of order (or resumed an existing world), and lets you submit existing items for newly-added quests (because I'm definitely going to update this ancient pack again).


Renamed most quests
Changed every cringy quest description
Fixed multiple typos in (almost) every quest
- I doubt I got them all, so feel free to report anymore you find

Disabled the update checkers for every mod that let me do so
- Due to [how ancient](https://howoldisminecraft1710.today/) this version of Minecraft is, it can cause issues (and annoying chat spam) since many of the servers have been taken down or moved - so it's best to disable them (and it's not like anyone's making mods for this version anyway lol).



# Balance changes

Disabled the Uncrafting Table
Changed a lot of stuff for Universal Coins
- Slashed the sell price of RF (now 5 coins for 10k RF)
- Added several items (but there's still way too many to add everything)
- Adjusted the spawn and droprates of coins

Tinker's Tools now cap out at level 5, and receive bonuses at levels 2 - 5
- New modifier slots are given at levels 3 and 5
- New tools start with 1 modifier slot

Added EMC values to a few items that were missing it
Restored the default recipe for the Watch of Flowing Time
Increased the difficulty of Runic Dungeons (to make them a high-risk, high-reward venture)
- Re-enabled the various artifacts from the mod
Added some modded ores to the Runic Dungeons generator


Heavily nerfed a lot of stuff from Draconic Evolution
Nerfed the capacity of Ender IO's Energy Capacitors
Slightly increased the capacity of the Leadstone Energy Cell
Tweaked the value of the Alchemical Coin


# Recipe changes

Made the ME Security Terminal much cheaper
Added a recipe to upgrade the Energy Acceptor into a Controller
Removed the Rotten Heart Grindstone recipe
Removed the Grindstone recipe for Bedrock and Command Blocks
Added a recipe to craft Iridium Reinforced Plates with Iridium Ingots
- I can't remove the default one though, so both are usable


Added a recipe for the Toaster
Changed the recipe for the Alchemical Coin Mill
Added a recipe to craft Raw Carbon Fibre with Charcoal Dust
Added recipes to process Thorium Dust (from Magneticraft)


Changed the recipe for the Green Heart Canister
- Now uses a Yellow Heart Canister + 1 Empty Canister instead of 2 Empty Canisters
Changed the recipe for the Mystical Cache
- Now costs 2 Obsidian Coins to craft 4 of them and is Shapeless
- Added a recipe that uses 5 Diamond Coins to craft 2 of them



# Quest changes

Tweaked the names of many quests
Tweaked the rewards of most quests
The Black Hole Band quest no longer consumes the band
Fixed a bunch of other broken quests I forgot to list


Greatly reduced the amount of items required for all the quests in "Endgame"
"Advanced Mana Generation" (previously named "Hard-to-Use Generating Flowers") no longer consumes the flowers
"Altar Upgrades" now explains what each Rune does


Rebalanced several rewards
Removed all the troll rewards

Overhauled the reputation system
- There's now only 1 reputation bar (which definitely isn't inspired by Half-Life)
- Said bar now renders in every chapter
- You gain points from almost every quest
- Some quests require certain rep thresholds to complete



# Misc changes

Replaced both Dark Mode texture packs with GTNH Dark Mode

Re-organized the tabs in the Thaumonomicon
- Vanilla order is unchanged
- Next is Thaumic Exploration
- Thaumic Tinkerer
- Electro-Magic Tools
- ConveyorCraft Compat
- Railcraft Compat
- AOBD Compat


Disabled Thermal Foundation recipes for Super Multi-Drills' items
Disabled Thermal Foundation and Tinker's Construct Drill Heads (from Super Multi-Drills)
Disabled all Thermal Foundation equipment
- The only exception is Invar Tools since they're used in MFR's recipes
Re-enabled ProjectE's Loot Orbs


Added power generation tooltips to Advanced Solar Panels
Added sorting rule tooltips to all Logistics Pipes modules
Added tooltips to all Sigils denoting their LP cost
- You still have to find out what they do on your own though (it's more fun that way, ya know?)

Renamed Credit Cards to Debit Cards
Fixed the names of a few items that aren't being localized for whatever reason
- Unfortunately, I can't get Resource Loader's lang file system working - so they're all renamed with CraftTweaker (meaning it's english-only). If anyone knows how to fix it, please let me know.

Disabled Nether Ores' Grindstone and Smelting recipes
Re-enabled Nether Osmium and Iridum Ores
