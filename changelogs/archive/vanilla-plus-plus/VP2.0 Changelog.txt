v2.0 Changelog:

If you want to keep your 1.19.3 save, copy it over from the previous instance! Join the Discord if you want me to help you do so.
(It'll load up fine, but getting it copied alongside your waypoints is more involved though)


You'll probably need to re-install the pack since I backported it, and existing worlds may not work (sorry if so). I probably should've made this on 1.19.2 in the first place, but oh well.


Main Changes:

Backported the entire project to 1.19.2
- This is most likely going to be the main 1.19 modding version until 1.20 comes out (but if not, I can always re-make the pack again)

Colourized rarities
- Epic is Purple, Rare is Blue, and Uncommon is Green (as per the universal standard one of my Discord friends enforces)
-- I can't colourize item names, but if anyone knows how let me know. Would love to do that so it's consistent
- I might add custom rarities later on (like in Quintessence), but for now these are fine
- The Heart of the Sea now has the "rare" rarity
- The Totem of Undying now has the "rare" rarity
- Echo Shards now have the "uncommon" rarity
- Diamond Scrap has the "uncommon" rarity




Recipe Changes:

Added a few Quality of Life recipes:
- 2x (any) Logs -> 16x Sticks
- 1x (any) Sapling -> 1x  Stick
- Tiny (Char)coal can now be combined back into (Char)coal
- The Coconut Husk has a bowl tag (as do normal bowls)
- Any recipe that uses bowls now uses the bowl tag (cleans up UI clutter and adds cross-mod compat)
- Added the Mushroom tag to red & brown mushrooms, crimson & warped fungus, and umbral fungus
- Mushroom & Rabbit Stew now use the mushroom and bowls tags
- Farmer's Delight recipes now use the bowl tag
- (Iron) Chains (and Gold Chains) are now cheaper (3 nuggets instead of 2 + 1 ingot)
-- Iron Chains are now crafted by combining a Chain with an Iron Nugget (or using 6 nuggets, makes 2 at once)


Improved the vanilla recycling recipes and added more of them
- You now get small scrap that can be assembled into a normal one, which can then be smelted into an ingot
-- This system isn't what I wanted to do, but I have to due to Minecraft limitations
- Iron, Gold, and Diamond have their own scrap items
-- Diamond and Netherite items can only be recycled in a Blast Furnace
- I might expand upon scrap or just replace it with a direct recipe in the future
Added a recipe to blast Echo Shards into Diamond Scrap
Added a recipe to blast Hearts of the Sea into Diamond Scrap
- Be sure to only process one item at a time though, otherwise you won't get the full amount
