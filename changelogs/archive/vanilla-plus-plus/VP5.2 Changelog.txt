v5.2 Changelog:


I've changed a few of the worldgen mods around, so you might need to make a new world.

It will prompt you to make a backup before entering existing worlds though, but said worlds might not work as expected if you load them on this version.



Main changes

Fixed the menu
Added a 1080p menu
Adjusted Archeology mod config
- Brushes can no longer break blocks
- Brushes take a bit longer to reveal items inside of blocks


Optimized scripts
- Should make worlds load a bit faster
All ore smelting recipes now use tags because I hate UI spam
- I've also adjusted the XP gains to better match the rarity of each ore
Added tooltips to all Mage Hands so players know what each one does
Added scrap tags to everything* that needs it
*Note that I might've missed a couple of items - but I'm pretty sure I didn't


Added Stone Sticks
- Acts like normal Sticks for all recipes that accept them
- Can be converted into Sticks
Changed the internal name of Iron Scrap (both kinds)
- Note that this will delete any you have, so be sure to process or give them back before updating
Imported the meltable_iron_big tag from The Essence of Everything: Quintessence
Soups & Stews now stack to 16
Updated all scrap textures



Bugfixes

Rails now have the meltable_iron_small tag




Balance changes

Old Combat Mod is now disabled by default
- I can't find a mod that lets me change damage values (like every other version of minecraft has ffs), so for now y'all have to suffer with the pointless cooldown (sorry)
Leathered Boots now require a Smithing Table instead of crafting



Recipe changes

Replaced all dye recipes with tag-supported ones
- Excludes combination recipes (e.g. red + yellow = orange)
- Recipes that give 2 dyes have their own tag (e.g. Lilacs)
- Added support for a few more item -> dye recipes


Smelting/Blasting Scrap now gives XP
Adjusted the XP gain for all recycling recipes
Smelting Candles into Honeycombs now takes half as long
Blasting Enchanted Golden Apples into Gold Scrap now takes half as long
Diamond Scrap can now be smelted in a Furnace
Diamond and Netherite Scrap recycling recipes can now be processed in a Furnace
- Changed Blast Furnace times to match other Blast Furnace recipes
Horse Amours now give Scrap instead of Small Scrap
Heart of the Sea now gives 8 Diamond Scrap (was 4)
Totem of Undying now gives 32 Scrap (was 64)


Changed the recipe for the Nether Salad
- Now uses the fungus tag (contains Crimson, Warped, Umbral, and the mushrooms from BetterEnd)
Added a recipe to make Torches with Tiny Coal/Charcoal
Changed the Chain Combination recipe for Paladin's Chains
- Now uses 2 Chains to make 1 Iron Chain (was 1 Chain and 1 Iron Nugget)
Chain and Gold Chain recipes now use tags and 3 nuggets (instead of the standard ingot + 2 nuggets)
- The recipe change applies to all Chains
- Cincinnasite Chains are the only exception since they don't have a nugget. Instead, I added an alternate recipe (1 ingot for 3 chains)
Added tag support to multiple recipes


Added recipes to smelt Dripstone into Clay
Added recipes to craft Dripstone from Clay
Added blasting recipes for all raw ore blocks
Added a recipe to smelt Pottery Shards into Clay
Added a recipe to blast Sculk Catalysts into Echo Shards
Added a recipe to blast Sculk Shriekers into Echo Shards
My Crying Obsidian -> Obsidian recipe is now a blasting recipe




Misc changes

Removed several duplicate recipes
Added the mushroom tag to items that were missing it
Added a new fungus tag for recipes that use nether items
Biomass now has a 75% chance to fill the Composter (was 70%)
Meaty Clumps now have a 70% chance to fill the Composter (was 65%)
