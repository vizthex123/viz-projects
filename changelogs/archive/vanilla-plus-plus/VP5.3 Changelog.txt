v5.3 Changelog:

Main changes

Updated the menu
- Discord button is now functional
- Replaced the Vanilla++ title with a high-res one

Added some loading screen tips

Tweaked Charm's config
- Goats now drop a bit more mutton
- Respawn Anchors can now be used in The End
- Villagers no longer trade treasure enchantments (like mending). Said enchantments are fairly easy to find in the world, and you should explore anyway since that's vastly more fun & rewarding





Balance changes

Raw Ore Block blasting recipes now take 45 seconds (was 30)
Reduced the arrow capacity of Basic and Copper Quivers
Reduced the XP gain from my raw ore block - > ore block recipes
The Ring of Attraction now has a range of 3 (was 5)
Replaced Charm's enchantment removal (using a Grindstone) with Grind Enchantments
- I've configured the mod to cost more XP than Charm used in exchange for curses being ignored
- The mod also lets you transfer enchantments between books for a small amount of XP





Recipe changes

Apples can now be turned into Biomass
Mushrooms can now be smelted into dyes
Music Discs can now be smelted into Disc Residue
Biomass and Meaty Clumps now require 9 items (was 8)
Added tag support to bark recipes from Farmer's Delight
The Bark -> Paper recipe now uses the bark tag
Organic Compost recipes now have tag support




Misc changes

Added the seed tag to everything that was missing it
Modded equipment now generates in "Better" buildings (like Desert Temples)
Changed the Ring of Attraction's Echo Shard recipe to make it more ring-esque
- Now smelts into 2 Lapis and blasts into 3 Redstone
The Homing (makes arrows home in on enemies) and Vigor (increases health) enchantments are now treasure enchantments
Enabled the Siphon (magnet for pickaxes) enchantment from VanillaTweaks
Soul Fire (block) now deals 50% more damage


Disabled VanillaTweaks' storage blocks
- Supplementaries does the same thing better
- Supplementaries' Sugar Cube has been disabled in favour of Charm's
Disabled the Bag of Sugar and Gunpowder from Crate Delight
Tweaked the Falling Tress config
- Trees are now a bit quieter when ending their fall
