v5.3.1 Changelog:


This'll probably be the last update since I don't really like this pack. The whole thing was just an experiment to see how viable Fabric is for my modpacks (it's not).

As always, feel free to report any issues you've got in the comments, on the GitHub, or in the Discord server.



Main changes

Imported the dye recipe fixer system from my other modpacks


Fixed the pause menu (removing the feedback and bug reports buttons)
Fixed loading screen tips not working
- Note that you might need to manually disable the old resource pack to get the new fixed ones to apply
- Added a few more


Added some custom collapsible categories to REI
Disabled Paladin's Furniture's update checker
- Meant to do this in v5.3 and forgot, oof



Bugfixes

Fixed Vines being used to make Brown Dye instead of Green
Fixed Orange Dye not being craftable with Red and Yellow

Dripleaves and Scute can now be used to make Green Dye
Various nether items can now be turned into dyes
