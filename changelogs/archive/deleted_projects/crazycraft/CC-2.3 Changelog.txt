v2.3 Changelog - Slight Tweaks
 

Removed Modular Powersuits
- Removed Numia
Added The Betweenlands
Added Anti ID Conflict
- Will always be disabled, since it's for dev use only (And it's easier to do that over reinstalling it every time) [Plus it should help load times be a tad fster, since the game wouldn't be trying to log every ID]

 

Edited several Aether values
- Unifed Aether value for main ingots (Copper, Tin, Bronze, Steel, Alumin(i)um)

Changed ConveyorCraft recipes, fixes exploits and unifies recipes

 

Added Achievement Book for Challenges
- It's called the "Challenge Book" (Unsurprisingly), but works off the honour system (Since I have no way of checking if you've built a factory), but it's the way for you to document the progress you've made with the mods
