Added Crafting Tweaks
Added Anti ID Conflict - will be disabled in all releases as it's only meant for modpack authors to fix ID conflicts, so there's no point having it increase load times otherwise.

 

Removed Inventory Tweaks
- Added Tweaked Inventory Tweaks (same thing but you can add custom configs for what goes where, and fixes a couple bugs)

 

Updated DragonAPI
Updated HEXCraft
Updated Hopper Ducts
Updated MeteorCraft

 

Removed Meldexun's Crystalic Void - causes crashes now, issuie reported to author. I doubt it'll be fixed though since this is such an old version of Minecraft.
Removed Thaumcraft Mob Aspects
Removed Refined Tools and Armor
Removed Boss Tools
Removed Chunk Purge - causes lots of lag
Removed Ender IO Recipes in Thermal Expansion Induction Smelter (EIORecipesTEInductionSmelter)
Removed Ender Enhancement
Removed Forbidden Industry
Removed Thermal Smeltery Redux
Remvoed Uncrafting Grinder - you can pretty much do the same thing with AetherCraft, so it's useless. Plus due to recipe order chagnes and how it works it can lead to exploits.
Removed Tinker's Steelworks
Removed Simply Platinum
Removed More Ores
