v2.2 Changelog - Mod Edits

 

Added ArmorStatusHUD
Added Diamond Plus
Removed Equivalent Exchange 3
- Sadly, causes lots of crashes & issues, EMCs constantly change by themselves, and the Calcinator doesn't work correctly
-- Removed guide for EE3
Removed EMC Condensor
- Crashes whenever you open the UI, I'm not sure why or what causes it
-- Plus it needs EE3 to work, so it wouldn't work at all
Added AetherCraft
- Replaces EE3. Was going to add ProjectE, but that's a bit too overpowered...so, instead you get AetherCraft. It's a bit more balanced (maybe too expensive, but I'll work on that as I find things I find unabalanced/if anyone suggests anything) but is still very cool & interesting.
-- Replaced EE3 guide with AetherCraft guide
