v2.0 Changelog

 

Removed Mariculture
Removed ElectroMagicTools
- Both of these add too much stuff, and it causes crashes & lag.

Added Compacter
- Renamed the Compacter to "Compactor"
-- This acts like the AutoPackager, but it's got an inventory and a bit more flexibility. The idea is touse whichever works with your setup, the AutoPackager (which needs a 1x3 space) or the Compactor, which is a bit more expensive but only uses 1 block. (Not counting any automatic piping for either of course)

Wrote guides for Resource Engineering and CandyCraft
- I might add some for other mods, but it depends. Most of them have got information already present in the game (with some kind of book), so the guides will only really be for more unkown mods or ones without in-game documentation.

 

* In order for this to work, I had to remove MoVillages
Changed the StartingInventory item amounts
Removed Alternate Terrain Generation
Removed Chain Armor, too many other mods add recipes for Chainmail Armour.
Removed Seared Brick de-craft with Diamond Pickaxe
Removed script stuff relating to the non-Curse mods I had to remove in v1.0
