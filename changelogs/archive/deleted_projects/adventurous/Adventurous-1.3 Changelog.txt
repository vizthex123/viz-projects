Rv1.3 Changelog

 

Updated Lots of Stuff
Updated Cyberware
Updated Treasure2

 

THIS BELOW SECTION IS NYI BECUASE OF BUGS!!!
Changed Set of Tools store to let you buy 4 at once
- This is because my recipes don't use the durability and idk how to do that.
-- Price is 150 Crurnea per item, so it's 4 Gold Crurnea and 8 Silver Crurnea to buy 4 Set of Tools
-- You can buy either 1, 4, 16, 32, or 64 at once
--- Stacksize changed from 1 to 64 so you can do this
==========================================================================================

 

Alright now it's implemented stuff.

 

---- Moved them to their own Store Tab, called "Tools" (might add more stuff to it later)
Moved Repair Paste and Set of Tools sales to the "Patchwork" tab
Swapped around store positioning
- Patchwork is above Tools shop now
You can now sell the Robosurgeon
- It's worth 10,000 Crurnea. You only need 1 to use Cyberware, so this lets you get rid of extras you might get from Loot Bags or exploring a lot. Will change price if it proves to be too high or low.
-- It gives you 2 Enderium Coins (because of stacksize restraints imposed by Minecraft), and you can sell each of those for 5,000 Crurnea. (Or make 150k RF)
--- Coins can be sold in "Minecraftian Store" store

 

Removed Coin of Fortune crafting recipe
- It's worth a lot and it's meant to be a cool rare item

Removed being able to sell Zinc, replaced with Titanium
- Zinc is semi-useful because of Railcraft now, but Titanium is still useless.
-- You can also use Titanium to make 32 Key Carver tools from Treasure2

 

Changed Arrow recipes
- Vanilla one gives 4, Natura gives 8, Twilight Forest gives 16

 

Reduced amount of loot the Loot Recycler needs to make a new bag
- Down to 500 from the default 1,500 (there's nothing about how much items are worth though so I'll have to play around with this a bit to see if it's balanced or not)
