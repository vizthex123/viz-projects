Beta v1.0 Changelog


Added Cosmetic Armor Reworked
Added Lag Goggles
Added Chunk Pregenerator
- I recommend disabling it after world creation as it acts weird in singleplayer.



Disabled Elemental Dimensions - suspected of causing really bad tickrate lag
- Hope to fix it soon because it sounds like a cool mod
