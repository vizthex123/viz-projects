BETA v0.0.5 Changelog

Updated JourneyMap

Added Chisel (Suggested by Beta Tester JerySprigs)
Added Ender Zoo
-Disabled Dire Slime from spawning (Slime made of dirt, spawns after you break dirt without a Spade)

Added Flesh2Leather
Added Forestry
Added Ore Dictionary Converter (This is because you get many different types of the same ore, so to counteract this I added this mod which lets you turn them all to 1 type [I'd say Thermal Foundation ones are the best])

Edited Chance Cubes config (Disabled clear inventory "loot")

Removed cooldown of "Do-Over!" (You can do it infinitely as long as you have the materials)

Can't change the Grinder recipe... it won't let me remove the recipe to add the new one :v you'll have to just use Credits to buy quartz then make it (I'd say Nether quartz, it's cheaper)

Added new "Buy" recipes for: (Cheap - Expensive)
Sand, Slimeball, Leather, Nether Wart, Nether Brick (Item), Blaze Rod

Changed recipe for Mana Infused Stone
Changed world a bit so it'll reset your world, sorry
-This shouldn't happen anymore though
