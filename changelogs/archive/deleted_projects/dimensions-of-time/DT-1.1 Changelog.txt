v1.1 Changelog - The Big Update

Added 20 quests total


Only managed to add half a row to the Periodic Table questline. Sorry.
Restructured Peridoic Table questline
Boosted Helium amount form Nether Star grindstone recipe
Hopefully fixed Lockdown not working
Fixed Uranium (MineChem) recipe
- Should be working now, if not please tell me

Remove HQM Heart recipe
- I had played around with using Hardcore mode on HQM, but decided not to.
Changed Certus Quartz "Buying" recipe
- Gives 3 Certus for 125 Credits
Changed Forestry T2 Bag recipes
- Uses 1,500 Credits instead of 5,000
-- As I find more "useful" backpacks I'll add recipes for them
Removed Cooldown time on "A Whole New World"
- In my testing, I noticied it was rather irritating to have to wait 3 Minecraft days to leave a terribly generated dimension.

Added recipe for redying wool to white
- Personally I don't like having 16 different colours of wool, I only use white wool. I'm sure some other people are like this too
-- The recipe is any wool colour in a Furnace shape (you can mix and match too, for example 1 Purple wool, 3 Blue wool, 2 Orange wool and 2 White wool will still work) and 1 bone meal in the middle. Gives 8 white wool.
Editied several quests
Increased rewards on some quests

Changed Mystcraft Crystal grindstone recipe to only 5% for 500 Bonus Credits
- This gives a higher chance of you getting the bonus credits, I'll change it if it's too OP
Added use for Geodite Block
- Can be ground into 5k Credits
-- Removed recipe for regular Geodite (So the only way to get it is the ore or a Mystcraft Crystal)

Angel Ring reward from Reward bags is rarer
Started working on Broex'yht-Y'Afht questline (IC2, Mekanism and Super Multi-Drills)
Expanded Broex'yht-Qrueag (Technology) questline





Mod Edits:

Added Uncrafting Grinder
Added EIORecipesTEInductionSmelter
Added Twilight Forest Portal Catalyst
- Costs 1 Diamond and 750 Credits
Added Craftable Nether Star +
- Disabled Blaze Powder recipe, as it conflict with the Glowstone-Redstone Mixture recipe.
Added Gany's Mods
Added Super Ores
- If it's too OP I'll remove it, but this is mostly for testing.
Edited Void Decay config
- Made it slower and pre-infect less chunks
-- The rate before this patch was a bit too fast
Editied MouseTweaks config
- Disabled mouse wheel scrolling (NEI and InventoryTweaks work together to do this already)
