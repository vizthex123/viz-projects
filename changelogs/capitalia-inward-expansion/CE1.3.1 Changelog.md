*Quick hotfix to tweak a few things I missed in v1.3*

# Main changes

Imported [v2.1.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models/files/5846382) of my Extra Models datapack

Fixed all the menu designs not rendering properly
- Also removed all the mod config buttons
- The menus now only load if you use the correct GUI scale (auto)

Changed the "Research" part of science data names to "Age"<br />
Changed the registry name of all the drill parts
- They're all prefixed with `drill_` now to be consistent
- Note that this will delete any existing items, so make sure you submit them before updating (or cheat them back in afterwards)



# Misc changes

Updated my Extra Data Models Trivia pack

Increased the reward of Project Expansion: Head to 1 Prestige Scrip (was 2 Chits)

Changed Sawdust recipes for Parchment to use Compressed Sawdust<br />
Fixed the Compressed Sawdust for the MDF Board not giving the correct amount

Moved all the recycling recipes that only give Shredded Hide or Fibers to the Mechanical Saw
- Note that this only applies to the recipes that had a single output. Multi-output ones remain in the Millstone.
- Also increased the Forgotten Hat's yield to 12 (was 8)

Added a recipe to saw Ravager Hide into Shredded Leather
- Remove the `forge:leather` and `expansion:binding` tags from it
