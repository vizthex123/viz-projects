v1.1 Changelog:


Main changes:

Create's Zinc Ore now needs a Stone Pickaxe instead of an Iron one to mine, fixing a softlock issue where you couldn't get to the Brass Age unless you found the much rarer Zinc from Bluepower
Bluepower's Gems, Silver, and Tungsten now require an Iron Pickaxe to mine
Enlightend's Ores now require a Diamond pickaxe to mine


Renamed the "Base" of Project Expansion to "Foundation"
Fixed Powah's config not loading into the game
Made a starting inventory (meant to do that in 1.0 lol)
Hid the Fluid Buyer and staged the Fluid Seller
Staged EnderStorage behind the Industrial Age

- Each one now require the crafting station to be crafted before the quest unlocks
- Buffed reward from finishing the pack to 5 (was 2)
- Tweaked the contents of the "Eternal Reward"
- Fixed the XP reward not giving levels when it should've
 

Replaced Scrap system with my standard one (from Quintessence and Vanilla++)
- For those who don't know, you get 1 Small Scrap per ingot of the recycled item (e.g. a Bucket would give you 3 Small Iron Scrap), 3 of which can be combined into a Scrap that you can blast into the corresponding Ingot
- Reduced the blasting time of each Scrap to 5 seconds
- This basically nerfs the amount of metal you can get from recycling random worldgen objects, but it's a lot more balanced and easier to work with internally

All Bluepower quests are now optional
