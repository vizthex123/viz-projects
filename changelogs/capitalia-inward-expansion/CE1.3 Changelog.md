*I'm planning a big overhaul/reboot (like I did with [Aurora's Adventurer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/auroras-adventurer/files/3011491)), but figured I'd do a final update to the 1.19 version first.*



# Main changes

Changed wiki link to the new wiki.gg one<br />
Changed the namespace of my custom tags to `expansion`<br />
Migrated some of my CraftTweaker scripts to KubeJS
- Mostly a backend change, but it might make the game load a bit faster

Fixed most of the known issues
- I can't fix the Alloy Furnace having recycling recipes when it shouldn't, but the rest of them have been fixed (as far as I can tell, at least)

Added a modified version of my [Extra Data Models](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models) datapack
- It supports the mods from this pack (which are in v1.6 for 1.19.2) in addition to a few changes exclusive to the pack
- Also added the [trivia pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia)

Removed the stuff Enlightend removed "for future mod content" from the scripts that used it
- I really hate how this dev just deletes content for no reason on old versions they won't even support ffs
- Replaced Starsteel in the Supports recipe with Cognitive Alloy



# Bugfixes

Fixed several other items missing tags

- Replaced it with other crafters in the couple of recipes that required one



# Recipe changes

Replaced Latex in Project Expansion recipes with Super Glue<br />
Replaced Leather in all recipes with the `forge:leather` tag<br />
My Smoking recipes for Flesh -> Leather now give Shredded Hide<br />

- Added an extra row of materials

Changed the Quicklime recipe for Parchment to use 4 Quicklime and craft 8 Parchment<br />
Tweaked Wallet recipes to require more Create Deco coins as the tier increases<br />
Added recipes to craft Wood Chips with Logs or Hollow Logs<br />
