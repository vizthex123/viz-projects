# Differences from Alpha 2

## Main changes

Added a 1080p menu

Added Blinking Ender Eyes<br />
Added Stoneborn - Modded Compatibility GUI<br />
Updated Stoneborn: Missing Mods<br />
Removed Stoneborn Inventory Tweaks Compat (I added support for it to modded compat)

Imported v3.0 of [Extra Data Models](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models)

Added a separate research for Broken Stone Data Chunks instead of slapping them in the Bronze Age<br />
Changed the recipe for the Iron Data Disc
- Now uses 2 Iron Ingots instead of 4
Changed the recipe for the Industrial Data Chip
- Now uses 2 Steel Ingots instead of 4 Iron Ingots
Changed the recipe for the Information Data Pad
- Now uses 4 Fluix Crystals instead of 2 Steel Ingots

Forestry's trees can now naturally generate<br />
Tweaked the requirements for the Processing Power challenge<br />
The "Technical Prowess" reward table can now give Lubricating Elixir 25% of the time

Added more items to forestry's backpack whitelists<br />
Adjusted the crafting times of all data discs, and tweaked the costs of a few of them
- Also swapped around the crafting times for research points (organic is now the fastest, and the regular recipe takes the longest)

Added a lot more stone types to the `reminted:rocks` tag<br />
Unified all the ore smelting recipes
- No, I won't disable the oregen because I like having multiple ore types. It's more funner!! (and better justifies the time i spent making a script to unify them all)

Most keybinds are now unbound by default<br />
Changed the registry name for the Trophy to `golden_trophy`<br />
Fixed Masterful Machinery's circuitry and energy ports being staged incorrectly



<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## Bounty changes

De-pluralized my custom bounty objectives<br />
Rebalanced a few bounties I forgot to list here<br />
Moved the Totem of Undying from the Gemologist to the Exotic Materials Investigator

Added a new bounty type: Exotic Materials Investigator
- Objectives are items that are rare (e.g. Ectoplasm) or gained in unconventional ways (e.g. Froglights)
- Rewards Prestige, Loyalty Points, and all types of research

Added some objectives to the Innovator bounties:
- Mekanism's alloys
- Amethyst Shards
- Nether Quartz
- Osmium, Black Iron, and Redstone Ingots

Tin Gears are now a common objective (was uncommon)
- Slightly increased the value of all gear types
Reprocessed Fissile Fragments are now a legendary objective (was rare)
- Greatly buffed their value, so you now get more rewards if they're an objective

Logistics Technician bounties can now give Lubricating Elixir
- It can also be bought once in the Intertemporal Emporium (2 for $50)
- This change was made to try and mitigate the early-game annoyance of needing lube or iron to craft gears for the multiblocks

Tweaked the value of Photovoltaic Cells and Lava Cans. The latter should a bit appear more often now.



<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## Economy changes

Rebalanced several item prices

All data discs are now sellable<br />
Coal and Iron Dust can now be purchased

Sand is now buyable ($1.50 each)<br />
String is now buyable (75Â¢ each)<br />

Furnaces now sell for $2 (was $3)<br />
Blast Furnaces now sell for $27.50 (was $20)<br />
Ravager Hide is now sellable ($100 each)


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## Quest changes

Stage and permit rewards are no longer team rewards, meaning that they (should) work properly in co-op.
- I know AdminShop uses FTB Teams, but 

Fixed "Craftability" not accepting crafting table variants<br />
Tweaked some quest rewards to encourage early-game automation<br />
Tweaked the unlock cost for Detour: Osmium Equipment<br />

Changed all the "Craftable Auomation" quests to "Automated Craftability"<br />


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## Recipe changes

Moved head processing recipes to the labs<br />
Added a recipe to craft Moss Blocks with Carpet<br />
Added a separate recipe for research using organic items<br />
Added an advanced alloyer version of the bronze recipe (uses half as much fuel and runs twice as fast)<br />
My Glow Ink Sac -> Ink Sac recipe now gives 2 Ink Sacs instead of 1

Small Item Inputs can now be upgraded into regular ones<br />
Moved the Advanced Alloyer recipe for Netherite Ingots to the Combiner and Induction Smelter<br />
Ravager Hide can now be converted into 2 Iron Data Discs in an Advanced Laboratory or shredded to get 4 Leather<br />
Smooth Stone can now be made with multiple Stone types<br />
Gearboxes now require Smooth Stone (was Stone)<br />
Vents now require some Smooth Stone

Added a recipe to convert Sculken Combs into Echo Shards<br />
Added recipes to upgrade Copper/Iron Chests into Basic Bins<br />
Changed the scanner's recipe (also made the Chest Module use tags)<br />
The Research Catalyst now requires Glass (was Sticks and Cobblestone or Smooth Stone)
- Now required for all research recipes to encourage early-game automation of it (the first autocrafting you can unlock is Quark's Crafter in the Bronze Age)
- Research recipes have been adjusted to try and curb the early-game grind (and try to keep the total crafting time roughly the same)


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## Misc changes

Reverted Flint and Steel requiring Steel<br />
Ectoplasm now has the `forge:slimeballs` tag<br />
Blaze Powder now has the `reminted:basic_fuel` tag instead of Blaze Rods
