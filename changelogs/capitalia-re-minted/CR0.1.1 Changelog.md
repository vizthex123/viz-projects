## Removals

Removed Mekanism and all of its add-ons
- It's a huge pain to keep up with this and balance this mod, and coupled with my unfamilarity I figured it'd be best to just remove the thing. I do love the paxels though, so I made sure to add a mod for them (although it sadly only supports vanilla materials).
