Beta 2 Changelog:


Main changes:

Added some quests
Tweaked a couple of loading tips to be accurate to changes I've made
Balanced Jet Boots to better fit the mid-game tier I want them at
- Disabled most of the upgrades
- Removed the non-Jet Boot items


Disabled some duplicate REI categories
Removed duplicate recipes for all AE2 cables
Removed more duplicate recipes I forgot to list
Added collapsible entries for AE2's cables and P2P tunnels
Improved the collapsible entries for Xychorium-Infused blocks
Blacklisted all Thermal Series machine UIs from being sorted


Added 8 custom machines:
- Amalgamation Station: Combines things into other things
- Coin Minter: Lets you combine coins (since each one is worth 10 of the previous). I'll probably refine this system in the future, but for now it's just a cheap multiblock
- Crystal Transmutate: Converts Xychorium into other colours (and Certus Quartz), and has a couple other recipes
- Dye Extractor: Extracts extra dye from valid items, and has unique recipes to process minerals
- Extractinator: Not yet implemented (it's not working properly), but if it ever decides to work it'll be like the extractinator from Terraria (I can't configure the mod as well as I'd like to, so I didn't use it due to that).
- Reprocessor: As the name implies, it processes varies items into other items (mostly items from Alex's Caves)
- Shredder: Replaces smelting recipes for Scrap (and nuggets), and has a few unique recipes
- Transmuter: Swaps between item/block variants at no cost



Standardized dye recipes
- Pretty sure I already had it in place, but if not you can now use all the default items (and some extras) to make dyes in one tagged recipe
- Said items can also be processed in a Dye Extractor to get extra dye (costing no RF) or Centrifugal Separator (costs RF, but gives more dye and some XP)





Bugfixes:

Removed an invalid recipe from the Sawmill
Fixed the names of several blocks & fluids that aren't properly localized
Fixed Stonecutter recipes for Xychorium-Infused Aluminum and Deepslate Bricks being removed
Fixed the Glowing RGB Viewer being hidden when it shouldn't be
