Beta 3 Changelog:

This will be the last beta before release, so hopefully it's good lol


Main changes:

Swapped trivia pack for the one I've published so updates are easier
Implemented all changes from v1.2+ of my Extra Data Models [resource pack](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/changelog.md)
Implemented all changes from v1.3+ of my Extra Data Models [data pack](https://github.com/vizthex123/ExtraDataModels/blob/main/changelog.md)
- Modpack-only changes:
-- Warden Predictions can now give into 3 Disc Fragments


Added a few more loading screen tips
Finally got custom ore variations working
- Each ore (and stone type) from mods that don't have native support for Excavated Variants now has variations (excluding Xychorium since the textures aren't working rn)
- A few don't have standard tags by default, so I had to add them manually. I did ask the dev why it's not working, so hopefully it can be fixed before release

Imported Quicklime from The Essence of Everything: Quintessence
