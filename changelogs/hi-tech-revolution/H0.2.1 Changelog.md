*Quick hotfix cuz I forgot to fix the falling trees config (I hate how it always resets the config ffs). Figured I'd toss in a few other changes as well.*

# Main changes

Added a few more loading screen tips<br />
Added a description to the Ender Pearl purchase quest (also placed "Buy" in the title for both it and Slimeballs)<br />
"Shop Membership" now requires 5 Iron Coins (was 1 Gold)
- Also fixed it not consuming the items

Re-added the `limestone` tag that I apparently deleted by accident<br />
Fixed the selling quest for Immortal Embryos not giving the proper amount of money<br />
