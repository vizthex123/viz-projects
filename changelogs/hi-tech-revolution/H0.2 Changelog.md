*This update will probably corrupt your world (because datapacks just can't do their damn job ffs), so you can either stay on 0.1 or make a new world.*

*I went ahead and marked v0.1 as a beta as well since the pack is still somewhat early in development. The old betas posted in the discord are now alphas.*

*I expect updates to disrupt worlds basically until 1.0 (and maybe even after that lol), but given how much time will pass between updates I doubt it'd be that much of an issue (you can just stay on the old versions, after all).*


<br /> <br />
