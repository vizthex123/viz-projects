# Main changes

Changed the modpack's quest progression mode to "Flexible"
- This means the quests are non-linear (so you don't have to go in order from A to B to C - you can just skip straight to C after finishing A)
- For now, this doesn't change much - but I will try to design quests to be more non-linear in future updates

Fixed the names of the items from Certus Quartz Reforged<br />
Re-added the old datapack for machines since I forgot the one that was in there was still pretty WIP lol

Updated [Vertical Nuggets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/vertical-nuggets)<br />
Updated [Extra Data Models](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models) and the [Trivia Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia)<br />

Added my [Dye Recipe Unifier](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/dye-recipe-unifier) datapack.<br />
Added my [Tinkers' Melting Recipe Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/melting-recipe-compatibility) datapack.
