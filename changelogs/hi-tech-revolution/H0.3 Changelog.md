# Main changes

*This doesn't have nearly as many changes as I'd planned, but it's been sitting on my drive for at least six months so far and I just wanna be done with it lol.*

*I need to do another huge overhaul so the pack actually has some kind of core theme/goal (it's pretty unfocused rn since I just tossed in a bunch of mods & called it a day), but I don't know when I'll bother doing so - so I might as well have this as a checkpoint of sorts, just in case I want to revert back to it.*

Added Name Fixer<br />
Added Stoneborn - Modded Compatibility

Removed STONEBORN - Meï's Additions for Modded GUIs<br />
Removed STONEBORN Inventory Tweaks compat
- Both of these are part of the modded compat pack

Updated Vertical Nuggets

Renamed a few biomes from Alex's Caves<br />
Added my [Team Abnormals Recipe Fixer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/team-abnormals-recipe-fixer) datapack<br />
Updated my [Extra Data Models](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models) to v3.10.2
- This time, it's using the CF download since i haven't really made any pack-specific changes.
- Also updated the trivia pack

Overhauled my recycling system
- We're now on recycling v4.0, and it'll be the new standard for all of my 1.20+ modpacks if i ever get around to updating them lol (still hoping i can convert it into a mod one day)
- This version simplifies the system to use generic Powdered Stone, Congealed Matter, and Scrap items. It's intended for larger packs (like mine), and should make the overall system easier to add (and use)
- Rather than returning varying item amounts like the old system did, you now get Congealed Matter (and possible some Powdered Stone/Scrap)

--------------------------------------------------
# Bugfixes

Fixed Compressed Sawdust not having a recipe<br />
Fixed vanilla ores not working in the Alloy Smelter<br />
Fixed Forestry's ores not having Excavated Variants<br />
Fixed a few random recipes that might not have been broken before v0.3 but idc enough to check


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# Balance changes

Disabled Railcraft's Invar recipe<br />
Gem dye extraction recipes now give 2 dye (was 3)<br />
The Crystal Resonance Generator now makes 5 AE/t (was 20)<br />
Reduced the sell price of Immortal Embryos to $500 (was $2,500)<br />
Re-balanced the energy and upgrade values for Mining Gadgets' items<br />
Buffed starting bread to 6 and removed the quest book (also added a notice stating that quests are optional)


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# Quest changes

"Shop Membership" now requires 1 Gold Coin (was 5 Iron)
- I lowered the price in v0.2.1 since you couldn't get too many coins at the time, but now that they're more easily obtainable I figured I'd revert it back to the intended price.


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# Recipe changes

Added Graphite to the ore fixer script
- Also added recipes to make it with Thermal's coal variants

Tweaked my quality-of-life torch recipes a tad<br />
Finally managed to add an Induction Smelter recipe for Railcraft's Brass Ingots

Added Zinc Dust and recipes for it<br />
Added Forestry's logs & planks to my custom wood crafting tags (so you can make chests & shit with them)<br />
Fluid Latex Refining now always gives Rubber instead of having a 50% chance<br />
Reduced the RF cost of melting Icicles to 2,000 (was 4,000)

The Bundle's recipe now matches the vanilla one<br />
Added a few missing items to the dye fixer script<br />
Added a recipe to convert Sculken Combs into Echo Shards<br />
Added a recipe to crystallize ender pearl dust into 2 ender fragments<br />
Imported my hollow log conflict fixer script from Capitalia: Re-minted
- I originally made it for this pack, but figured I'd expand upon it so I could use it in other packs (and maybe make that recipe fixer mod eventually lol)



<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# Misc changes

Both types of Apatite now work in the Lapidary Dynamo<br />
Prismarine Crystals now give 60k RF in the Lapidary Dynamo (was 80k)<br />

## Replacements

Functional Storage with Storage Drawers - i do like Functional Storage a bit more, but without the [extra wood add-on](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/functional-storage-extra) it's a bit annoying. Might re-add it the future if said add-on ever gets ported.

<br />

## Removals

Ad Astra: Proxima Plus - causing an unrecoverable crash (and it was deleted since I took so long on this update lol. If it ever gets re-listed on CurseForge, I'll re-add it).<br />
The Endergetic Expansion - it's crashing and i can't be fucked to find out why<br />
Quark - doesn't really fit the pack (and i don't wanna keep track of all the random shit it adds lol). Woodworks' Chest variants are still avaliable if you like using them (and i can't stop you from re-adding Quark if you *really* want to)<br />
