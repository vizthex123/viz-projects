v6.1 Changelog:

Main changes:

Changed the internal name of Iridium Chunks
- This will erase existing ones, so be sure to either convert them into cells or give yourself whatever went missing after updating the pack
Properly disabled FTB Chunks death points
All FTB Chunks controls are now disabled by default to avoid a repeat of the unitcircle incident (https://discord.com/channels/758106282481156146/758106283046862882/1069118641313947658)
Swapped out Stoneborn Extended for Stoneborn Modded Compatibility



Recipe changes:

Added pulverizer recipes for Cobalt
Added a Crushing recipe for Block of Raw Soulstone
Crushing/Pulverizing Cobalt now gives Iridium Chunks (15% chance)
- Recipes that give Iridium Chunks will give more of it when done in the Crushing Wheels, but more primary output when done in the Pulverizer
Standardized outputs of ores I added to the Crushing Wheels and Pulverizer


Added the Sythian Stalk -> Gold Nuggets recipe to the Redstone Furnace
The Subzero Ash -> Charcoal recipe is now a 40% chance (was 50)
The Quicklime recipe for Steel now only needs 8 Quicklime (was 16)
