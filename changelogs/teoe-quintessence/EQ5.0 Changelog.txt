v5.0 Changelog:

WARNING: This update WILL corrupt your old worlds due to a datapack error I can't fix! You'll have to either manuallyÂ fix it, make a new world, or just play the old version.

Sorry about this, but I have no clue what's wrong or how to fix it. Hate when this happens... one of many reasons I hate this stupid datapack system.


In other news, I like this new changelog template, so I'm gonna start using it from now on.



Bugfixes:

The Blazing Quartz, Processed Soulstone, Diamond, and Emerald Singularities now use the intended amounts of their resource to be crafted
White Puffball Stew now stacks to 1, preventing the issue OMGCALLUMMM reported where an entire stack gets consumed at a time
Changed the Limestone recipe for Steel
- Instead of the planned 8 Limestone, it now uses 1 Limestone, 4 Iron, and 16 Lime
- This is the only way I fix the recipe without making like 6 duplicates of it (which I hate doing), but I might change it later on


Mods that fixed themselves:
Pulverizer Catalysts showing up in the Phytogenic Insolator has been fixed in some version of Thermal Expansion
Apotheosis enchantments can now be used in the Dischantment Dynamo
Enigmatic Legacy's tooltips now work properly when wearing an Enigmatic Amulet or Dormant Eye
The Flugel Tiara bar overriding toughness is now fixed since I changed the default bar placement
- If you prefer the toughness bar on the right, by all means, change the config. Client-side mods like that are meant to be configured, after all.




Quest Changes:


Changed "A Short Jaunt" to require 100,000 distance walked
- This now means you walk 1 actual minecraft kilometer, as the description says.
- Slightly buffed bread reward
Dynamo quests are now optional (excluding "Burning Power")
Replaced the Ward-Enforced Belt quest (since a mod update removed the belt)
"Halitosis" is now optional


Tweaked the reward for "The Essence of Everything"
Technological Revolution now requires ingots instead of raw ore, reduced copper gear reward to 1
Added optional quests to make an Energetic Infuser and Tesseract
Removed the RF coil reward from Vacuum'd



Recipe Changes:

Replaced the Ultimate Chunk Loader in the Quintessence recipe with a Spot Loader
Hollow Logs -> Planks now gives 4 planks
Added Sawmill recipes for modded woods
AE2 presses now require 2 Emerald Coins instead of 1 Emerald and 1 Gold
Added a Combination Crafting recipe for Fluix
- Uses nether materials, but doesn't require you to wait around for 20 minutes


The Creative Crate now requires Diamond Grit instead of Magic Dust
The Creative Cake now requires Magic Dust
Added recipes for the Creative Energy, Item, and Fluid Cells
Added a recipe for the Creative Mana Tablet
Added a recipe for the Creative Motor



Balance Changes:


Pulverizer Catalysts
Buffed the energy reduction of Wrappist Shards to 70% (was 90)
Reduced the energy reduction of corundum to 90% (was 85)


Induction Smelter Catalysts
Reduced the use chance of Magic Dust to 25% (was 75)
Reduced the use chance of Sky Stone Dust to 50% (was 85)
Reduced the use chance of Cinnabar Dust to 70% (was 80)


Phytogenic Insolator Catalysts
Ash now gives 15% more auxiliary output
Added Hex Ash (same as Ash, but gives 25% output instead of auxiliary, and has a lower use chance)



Item Changes:

Added an Artificial Dragon Egg, used to craft Quintessence
- This allows you to get Quintessence without killing the Ender Dragon
Added the magic_dust tag to Gem Dust from Apotheosis
Added the rare rarity to the Infused Diamond & Ender Pearl from RF Tools
Added the shadow rarity to the Ender Crafter & Alternator
Firecracker Bushes now give Orange Dye instead of Pink



Misc:

Updated the Stoneborn texture pack

Removed Armor Toughness Bar (Ported)
- Armor Points does the same thing
