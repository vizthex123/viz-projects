v6.0 Changelog:



Main changes:


Fixed the menu (again)
- Seems like it differs based on your monitor's resolution, and idk how to make it scale based on that, so unless your monitor is also 2560x1440 it'll look kinda weird
- Changed the title so it looks less squished

Imported my scrap system from Vanilla++
- Recyable items will now have a tag, and can be smelted into Small Scrap
- 3 Small Scrap makes 1 Scrap, which can be smelted into 1 corresponding resource
- Accepted items are equal to those from Vanilla++ v4.0, plus some TEoE-specific ones (like Thermal Series items)
- Diamond Scrap now takes 5 seconds to smelt instead of 10

FTB Chunks no longer makes death waypoints
- It's a feature of the mod, but gets annoying since they render like JourneyMap's waypoints
- Change the client config if you want them back




Quest changes:

Tweaked some quests in "Beneath the Waves"
- If they don't have visible lines, they're optional
"Chained Defense" now requires Chainmail Armour instead of Chain Plating
Fixed the typo in "Cast Storage"
Renamed the flux storage quest to "Fluxtastic Storage"
- Fixed the broken dependency it had, so you can now complete it properly
"Nice & Bundles" and "Alien Stones" are now optional
Renamed "Boating Around" to "Boating About the Place"
"Scrolls" is now optional

- Ropes and Glowsticks are the only exception since I can't do percentage chances on it


Balance changes:

Tweaked the output of several sawdust recipes
Gold Wallets can now manually convert coins
- Since these options are in the serverconfig folder, you may need to copy it manually

Miscellaneous changes:
