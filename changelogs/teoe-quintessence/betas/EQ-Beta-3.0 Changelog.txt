B3.0 Changelog:


Disabled the uncrafting table since there's so much stuff to blacklist
- There's also very few times you really *need* to uncraft anything, and there's usually other ways to process useless items. I might re-enable it later, but I doubt it.


Reduced the rope coil recipe to give 6 instead of 8 per craft
Added a recipe to convert Additional Addition's ropes into rope coils (at a 4:1 ratio)
Tweaked the power stats for a few Industrial Foregoing machines
Reduced the cost of the Lead Anvil
Removed the Raw Tin reward from "Burning Power"
The Nether Portal quest now requires Flint & Steel, and gives a Queen's Slime Ingot rather than a Flint & Steel
Added quests for Industrial Foregoing, and some other mod items
Added multiple gems to the Lapidary Dynamo
Fixed Kelp Blocks giving the wrong RF in a Stirling Dynamo
Fixed the wooden hopper upgrade recipe not actually upgrading it
Fixed the wooden hopper being too expensive


Changed randomium ore drops to be a whitelist instead of a blacklist
Added a recipe to pulverize Blank Runes into Lead Coins
Finished off the AE2 questline
Added quests for XNet and the Wormhole mod
Changed the Energy Acceptor upgrade recipe to use 2 fluix + 2 charged certus quartz
Started working on the exploration questline
Added a few more quests for Create

Replaced Portality with Wormhole (Portals)
- Portality is buggy and crashes the game, but I might re-add it later since the portals are pretty cool


Added Essentials


Removed Dark Utilities


Updated Applied Energistics 2
