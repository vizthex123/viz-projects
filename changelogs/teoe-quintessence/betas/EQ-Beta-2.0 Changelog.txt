B2.0 Changelog


Made a list of known issues, viewable here: https://github.com/vizthex123/viz-projects/issues/4


Fixed custom tooltips not rendering on multiple items
The Thermal Expansion Machine Frame can be used in the alternate Redstone Furnace recipe (smoker + furnace)
- Added Quark furnaces to recipe
Changed the icon for "Item Retention"
Added a tag to furnaces that can be used for the quest and several recipes
Changed the "Storage" quest to accept any chest with the forge:chests/wooden tag
Changed basic TE machines to only need the dynamo quest started, rather than completed


Added more quests for Create
Added a quest to make a Flower Pouch
Added a quest to make a paxel (any kind)
Added a recipe to pulverize Music Discs into Lead Coins
Added a recipe to pulverize Limestone into Bones (since you can find fossils in them IRL)
- This will be removed when ContentTweaker updates and I can add a custom Lime item, that can then be processed into various things
Added a recipe to make ladders with sticks
Buffed the rope recipe to give 2 per craft
Blacklisted a few mods from randomium ore drops



Removed Engimatic Graves
- Enigmatic Legacy does the same thing (though it sometimes spawns above your head after you die), and removing this (hopefully) fixes some issues that both mods had while trying to fight over items
