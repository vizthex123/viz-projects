B5.0 Changelog:


The modpack now has a proper icon in-game!

If you check the quest list in FTB Quests, you'll notice the proper texture for Quintessence is there (and it's on the end-game questline too)


Added all my planned custom items, with the main one being Quintessence
- This replaces the bedrock placeholder, and I've removed the placeholder info from that quest
- I was going to consider the modpack released after I added custom items, but I would like to make this the final beta *just in case* (and there's still a couple other issues)


Activating the Twilight Forest portal now requires a Portal Catalyst
- Thanks to the dev of Twilight Forest Portal Catalyst for the texture
- The quest now requires a Portal Catalyst instead of a Diamond
- Players can craft the catalyst with 2 Steel or Hepatizon Ingots and a Diamond in a Basic Table


Questlines are now hidden until you unlock the starting quest(s) in each one
- This prevents visual spam and - as suggested by CubixThree - helps players know what to focus on
- "The Basics", "Storage & Relocation", "Multiplayer Utilities", and "Extradimensional Emporium" are exempt from this rule since the latter 2 are optional, and the former 2 are rather basic things I assume most Minecraft players know about


Disabled Quark's Totem of Holding since Enigmatic Legacy's amulet does the same thing (and the keep inventory quest)
Added recipes to make Torches with most fuel-style items
Coinfication recipes now use 3,000 RF
Added Crushing Wheel versions of all coinification recipes (takes 5 seconds each, about half the time of the pulverizer ones)

Vastly reduced the cost of Extended Crafting's tables
- Both regular and auto tables have reduced crafting costs, and integrate with Lightman's Currency + 1 other mod (varying based on the table)
Tweaked the Waystones config a bit
- Max XP cost is now 5 levels
- Scrolls are used a bit faster than Warp Stones
