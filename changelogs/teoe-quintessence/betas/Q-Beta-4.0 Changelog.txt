B4.0 Changelog:


Finished the Twilight Forest questline
- All of the quests need better rewards, so please suggest what should grant which thing.
Finished the Aquamirae questline
- Since it's rather light, I also added some general water-y quests to it
Changed the recipe for bedrock
Changed the "Advanced Crafting" quest to require an Ultimate Crafting table, and changed its name to "Unparalleled Crafting Power"
- Buffed rewards
Added a quest to make a Basic Crafting Table
Added rewards to The Essence of Everything quest
- Also changed the subtitle
Added more things to the Fuel Canister's list of accepted items
- You can also craft it with any fuel item to fill it

Replaced rewards on Heated Processing with 4 Arcane Charcoal Fragments
Fixed burn times for Block of Arcane Charcoal and Blazing Quartz
Changed the reward for "Endearing Flames" to Arcane Charcoal
Amethyst Shards can now be used as a Pulverizer Catalyst
Corundum can now be use in the Lapidary Dynamo

Removed the duplicate Fire Charge recipe

Removed the duplicate End Crystal recipe

Hid creative-only items from JEI
Hid infested blocks from JEI


Removed the duplicate Fiery Ingot recipe
Added JEI info for how to get tickets
Tweaked some recipes for Lightman's Currency's items
- Changed recipes for coin piles & blocks to use the Multiservo Press
- Changed wallets to use shaped recipes, but also have upgrade recipes
Coins can spawn inside of naturally generated chests from mods
- Not every chest has been added though, as I don't know what all of them are
Overhauled default coin drops to be more balanced, and add mod support
- Most enemies will drop Copper or Iron coins (worth 10 each), but some rare/more powerful ones will drop gold or higher.
- Bosses will drop a large amount of coins when killed, depending on how difficult they are to kill
Randomium can now drop coins (excluding diamond and netherite ones)
Tweaked spawnrates of theatres



Removed Enchantment Descriptions
- Other mods do the same thing
Removed MiniCoal
- The same items are added by Malum, so this is now just a duplicate mod


Added FTB Ranks
Added FTB Chunks
Added Loyalty Rewards
Added Lightman's Currency
Added Lightman's Discord Integration
Added QuickTeleports (suggested by Shadow_of_Nobody)
- All of these are meant for servers, but have some use in singleplayer - which will be expanded upon as time goes on
- It's annoying and rather time-wasting to maintain a separate server pack instance (like I did with Capitalia), so instead I'm bundling it all together.
