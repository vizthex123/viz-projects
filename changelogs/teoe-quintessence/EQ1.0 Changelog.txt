v1.0 Changelog:


The pack is now fully released!

Due to this, I consider it mostly content-complete. I'll probably make a few more versions to polish things up, add quests for stuff I missed, etc. - but, it's now basically complete

So yeah, enjoy gathering the Essence of Everything once more - and be on the lookout for more content
