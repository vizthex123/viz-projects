*As always, remember to make a backup of your world so you can revert to the previous version if needed (since modern modding will randomly corrupt your world due to datapack errors for no damn reason)*

*Decided by the Discord poll, I'm porting the pack to 1.19.2 (can't do 1.20.1 since Tinker's hasn't been ported yet and i don't wanna make the pack without it), so this will be the final update for the 1.18 version (until I inevitably find major issues lol).*
 
*As per usual, it started as a small patch and evolved into a big update lol*

<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# Main changes

Added my [Stoneborn: Missing Mods](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods) texture pack
- This took me *far* too long to make, but it's the only Stoneborn add-on for the all the mods it adds support for (that I could find, at least)

Added my [Extra Data Models](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/extra-data-models) datapack (and the [Trivia Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia))

Imported my [Melting Recipes Compatability](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/melting-recipe-compatibility) datapack
- I originally made it for this pack, but figured I could publish it (kinda like what happened when I first made Extra Data Models lol)
- Due to this, I was finally managed to make Chains cheaper (like I always wanted to)

Added three custom machines:
- Coinifier: Holds the coinification recipes I had, making them easier to manage and less spammy for regular processing machinery
- Arc Furnace: Replaces my Induction Smelter recipes for scrappable items. Gives you double the output (in terms of nuggets - so 6 nuggets instead of 1 small scrap) for 50% more RF.
- Shredder: Replaces my recycling recipes (including Scrap). Also added several new ones based on my new recycling system.
-- The only exception is Candles

Overhauled my scrap system
- Added Emerald scrap
- Added Steeleaf scrap
- Tiny Iron and Gold no longer have the nugget tag
- Tag is now `scrappable/type` instead of `meltable_type` (e.g. `scrappable/copper` instead of `meltable_copper`). Furnace recipes have also been removed in favour of Shredder recipes. This is my new standard for the system, and I'll update all the modpacks that use it soonâ„¢
- Most items now have a scrap tag, but I excluded a few due to the new progression order being custom machines -> smeltery (that way you're encouraged to use it as a metal recycler)

Imported my ore smelting fixer script from [Hi-Tech Revolution](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hi-tech-revolution)
- Also removed my blasting recipes for raw ore blocks


Added a few loading screen tips<br />
Changed all the messages occasionally printed in chat from quest rewards to dark purple text<br />
New worlds now start with an Eccentric Tome that has the default guidebooks inside of it (instead of having them all be in separate slots)<br />
Fixed the gap between pause menu buttons<br />
Tweaked the menu designs
- Changed the wiki link
- Made sure the Discord button actually links to Discord


Changed the namespace of my custom tags to `quintessence`<br />
Changed the model & texture for the Artificial Dragon Egg
- It's now a block instead of an item


Migrated some of the CraftTweaker scripts to twilightforest
- Mostly a backend change, but it might make the game load a bit faster



<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# Bugfixes

Re-enabled item scrolling (no clue why it was disabled in the first place lol)<br />
Fixed Quantum Quarry's pump upgrade not requiring an Upgrade Base<br />
Fixed the Matrix Enchanting Table not being a separate block even though it should've been


Added a log recipe for Minecraft chests
- I intended to add this alongside the plank recipes, but never got around to it
Fixed the Comparator recipe not showing up<br />
Fixed the Artificial Dragon Egg quest<br />
Fixed Refined Pipes not being recyclable<br />

- Also disabled (as much as I can, at least) Tinkers' Rose Gold
Fixed energy and fluid pipes being used in some stuff even though they're deprecated (reported by unitcircle in the feedback channel)<br />
Fixed Myalite not showing up in the worldgen of The End
- For some reason, Vazkii didn't fill out Quark's default config with parameters for modded biomes - but I fixed it!
- Tweaked the spawnrates of Myalite to be a bit more balanced with the slight biome variety
- Before fixing the worldgen, I added some recipes for it. Said recipes still remain just in case you can't find it (or it breaks and doesn't generate), but I'l probably remove them in the next update
Fixed Rose Gold Blocks not being decraftable into Tinker's Rose Gold (reported by unitcircle in the feedback channel)
- Kind of a band-aid fix, but it's the only way I can fix it without having to rebalance/overhaul a lot of stuff
Fixed bows dropped by the Snow Queen not being coinifiable with Crushing Wheels<br />
Added a recipe to coinify the Ender Bow (as intended from the start)


Fixed my custom Create recipes using the wrong durations<br />
Fixed a few milling recipes not giving the correct amount<br />
Fixed a few Sawdust recipes not giving the correct amount<br />
Fixed the default Granite -> Red Sand milling recipe being removed when it shouldn't be
