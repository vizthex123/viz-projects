v4.0 Changelog:


I'm gonna try out new formatting for changelogs where I group things together instead of having a big list of stuff. Let me know whatcha think.


Bugfixes:

Fixed Fiery Essence not being accepted in the Magmatic Dynamo when it should've been
Fixed the Pump Upgrade not using the proper items, and having an Ender Crafting recipe
Fixed some recipes made for Pendorite using Platinum instead



Quest changes:

Added optional quests for Tesla Coils and Steam Engines
Fixed the slimeball purchasing quest not consuming coins
Disabled completion toasts for all the shop quests
Fixed the description of "A Twilit Realm"
The "Blocky Measurements" quest now accepts the Abacus from Quark, as does the recipe for Quintessence does the same
Changed the rewards for "Refinitive Refining", "Flash Freezing", and "Vacuum'ed"



Recipe Changes:


Singularities now require 1,000 of each material instead of 10,000
- The only exceptions are Processed Soulstone (500), Blazing Quartz (1,500), Diamonds (100), and Emeralds (250)
Overhauled my sawdust recipes to give 1 Sawdust per plank used in the item's crafting recipe
- The Mechanical Saw recipes will now give 50% extra sawdust (to encourage you to use it over TE's sawmill)
- Removed sticks as an output from every recipe that gives Sawdust
Removed the sawmill recipe for wool -> string
- The Multiservo Press lets you unpack it into 
- Add tag support to the Multiservo Press recipe
The compressed sawdust recipe for sticks now uses 2 instead of 3
Armour Stands now saw into Sticks instead of Sawdust
Added more sawdust recipes
Added mechanical saw recipes for regular sawmill recycling recipes
- They will give sawdust rather than the recycled resources


Removed my Induction Smelter recipes for Raw Ores & their blocks
- You'd get *way* too much from them when using Catalysts, and I can't disable catalysts for custom recipes, so I'm just going to remove them for now.
- Hoping to re-add them soon though, because they were some of my favourite recipes
- Iridium has been migrated to the raw ore recipes for each thing, and washing recipes have been added
Simplified my torch recipes to just have a 4x and 8x output
Extended Crafting's tables now require Coins instead of Coin Piles
- Larvitar suggested this, and although I've gotten a lot of coins fairly quickly during playtesting; you do need some basic industry set up to make Coin Piles (due to me changing the recipes) - but tables are required for multiple things, so this makes it a bit easier to get them


Added recipes to get Fiery Essence
Added recipes to coinify Twilight Forest's Scepters and the Maze Map Focus
Removed the upgrade recipes for Extended Crafting's tables
- You need one of each table to do things, but I made the upgrade recipes before making recipes inside the tables, and just never got around to removing them
Moved the Zinc recipe for Fuel Canisters to regular crafting
Removed the useless secondary recipe for Capacitors
Added Subzero and Therium Shards to the Enhanced Golden Apple recipe
Added a pulverizer recipe for Raw Platinum


Changed the pulverizer recipe for Raw Quartz -> Quartz to only give 1, with a 50% chance for an extra
Added mechanical saw recipes to recycle Lightman's wooden shops
Added a recipe to pulverize or crush subzero crystal blocks into shards
Removed Experience Nuggets from the Wrappist Block crushing recipe
Changed my Lime(stone) + Iron -> Steel recipes to use 8 Lime(stone) and 4 Iron
Changed the Ash -> Charcoal recipes to use 4 Ash, and have a 50% chance of giving a Charcoal
Added recipes to saw leather armour into leather
Added recipes to coinify Charms of Life & Keeping


Removed Induction Smelter recipes for slime crystals
Changed my Induction Smelter recipe for Travertine to blasting & smelting recipes
Added a recipe to repair Long Fall Boots with Combination Crafting
Quartize Sand can now be processed into Nether Quartz and Sand
Pendorite can now be used instead of Manyullyn when making The Ultimate Ingot



Balance Changes:

Reduced Fiery Essence to 75k
Replaced the alloy singularities with Nether Quartz, Blazing Quartz, Certus Quartz, and Apatite
Replaced the Platinum Singularity with Processed Soulstone
Increased coinficiation of Spellstones to 20k Essenarium (2 diamond coins)
Moved the Portal Catalyst to Mechanical Crafting
- This means it's technically accessible a tad earlier, though I might re-add the Basic Table version later
Reduced the capacity of item vaults to 8 stacks (512 items) per vault block
Improved Extractors can now filter items
Changed the Black Hole upgrade recipes to use tiered ender items, rather than a regular ingot each time



Item Changes:

Added Processed Soulstone to the Lapidary Dynamo (25k per)
Removed the minecraft:coals tag from Arcane Charcoal
Added tooltips to the quarry blocks
Removed the coal generator from Wormholes



Misc:

Finally fixed the Wormhole mod not saving my configs
- So now the mod is properly configured, only took like 2 updates
AE2's blocks now shows RF by default
Lava Buckets no longer let you delete items from your inventory
Ender Alternators now increase the crafter speed by 3% per
Reduced Wrappist to 65k RF in the Lapidary Dynamo
Magic Dust can now drop from Randomium
Added JEI info for how to get Magic Dust
Hid Titanium's technical items from JEI



Mod Changes:

Added Lazy Data Fixer Upper
Re-Added Iron Jetpacks
- Balanced the mod out so it requires some work, just like the Flugel Tiara from Botania
- This also gives the Tesla Coil more things to charge, which is nice
