# Recycling Standards

Really hope I can convert this into a mod soon. Would make it a lot easier to manage lol.


## Sawdust
Full blocks take 5 seconds, partial ones are 3, misc/small things are 1 or 2

1 Plank = 1 Sawdust<br />
1 Slab = 0.5 Sawdust<br />
1 Stick = 0.25 Sawdust


## Other

Processing time varies by item

1 Leather = 1 Shredded Hide<br />
1 String = 1 Fiber

Other items are converted into regular items (e.g. Brick derivatives become Clay Balls)
